<p class="tch">An Unrecorded Philadelphia Romance
the Franklin Family helped into
Flower</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was at a musical party given by the
great Franklin a few months after he
returned from London to Philadelphia, in
1762, that Betsey Shewell first met Benjamin
West and entered with him through the
ever-swaying gates of Romance. At the
time she was known as a belle of the Quaker
City, and he is best described by that keen
observer of mankind, Doctor Jonathan Morris,
as "a young painter of fine parts enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
his native haunts after the glamour of
European capitals."</p>

<p>The modest Franklin house in the heart
of the city was at that time a Mecca for the
choice spirits of the colonists. Statesmen,
scholars, and men of wealth trod the pebbly
street to the philosopher's through all
hours of the day until long after candle-lighting
time. Benjamin Franklin meant
many things to many people. It is small
wonder that poor Mrs. Franklin often
lamented that her "Pappy," as she called
her husband, was unhappily affected with
a too tender and benevolent disposition, and
that all the world claimed the privilege of
troubling him with their calamities and distress.
But still the lady loved her kind,
especially those with good ears, tradition
says, and the night that "Pappy" gave this
frolic for his buxom daughter Sarah she
smiled at the company with broad good-humor.
And, knowing this (for otherwise
there would have been no party at Franklin's),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
we can raise the curtain on the scene
with impunity, and listen to the ghostly
wails of violins, the tinkles of tired spinets,
and the long-lost voices of the company.</p>

<p>The night-shutters before the windows of
the Franklin parlor are open, for it is the
summer time. About the wide, plain room
with its few embellishments the guests are
grouped in a circle. The host seems to be
in a merry mood, and is strumming away on
the famous guitar, a knowledge of which he
was always ready to impart to his intimate
female acquaintances. The ever-laughing
Sarah, who seldom sighed for more than
the days brought to her, is in her element.
She is having a party, and she knows that
there is a spicy Madeira punch in the Staffordshire
bowl her father purchased as a
gift for her mother in England, and a high
pyramid of sweet cakes their faithful Abigail
made that morn adorns the sideboard.
As she flits out into the entry she nudges a
girl who is seated by the door, one of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
group composed of Mr. and Mrs. Abram
Bickley and good Doctor Jonathan Morris.
The girl answers her invitation to join her
with a wan and unresponsive smile. Her
rather piquant face is suffused with sadness,
and she pays no heed to the remarks of her
companions. It is easy to see that Mrs.
Bickley is annoyed by her behavior. Many
eyes are focussed on her fine full gown
of soft lustring, but she seems unaware of
their attention, for the lady is Miss Betsey
Shewell, who is indulging herself in a fit
of the vapors.</p>

<p>Betsey Shewell had been crossed in love.
Like a foolish maid, she had given her heart
where it was not wanted, and the object of
her affections, Isaac Hunt, a young gentleman
from the West Indies, was then paying
desperate court to her niece, Mary Shewell,
a girl of her own age.</p>

<p>Isaac Hunt, the spoiled heir of an aristocratic
Tory family settled at Bridgetown
in the Barbadoes, must have been something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of an Adonis. His son, the gifted gossiper
Leigh Hunt, whom Charles Lamb referred
to as "The Indicator" in the famous couplet
he addressed to him, wrote of his father,
"He was fair and handsome, with delicate
features, a small aquiline nose, and blue
eyes. To a graceful address he joined a
remarkably fine voice, which he modulated
with great effect." It was in reading with
this voice the poets and other classics that he
made conquest of the two girls' hearts.</p>

<p>The image of this fascinating gentleman
was constantly haunting Betsey Shewell's
mind as she sat moping by the door of Benjamin
Franklin's parlor at the close of a
summer's day one hundred and forty-one
years ago. That very evening she knew he
was to ride over from the Red Lion to visit
Mary Shewell, then staying with Betsey
Bickley at Penn Rhyn, the Bickley country
house, five miles below Bristol on the Delaware.
He was with his "shy, dark-haired
Mary" now, no doubt. Try as she would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it seemed impossible for her to forget him.
Her sister Bickley, observing her sad face,
began to fidget. She looked at her with disgust
and was about to speak, when the sound
of the knocker suddenly reverberated
through the house, and Sarah, hastening
to open the front door, welcomed in a party
of belated guests.</p>

<p>"Betsey Shewell! Betsey Shewell!" resounded
the voice of the indefatigable
Sarah over the babble of feminine tongues
in the hall. "Betsey, I want to present to
thee Mr. Benjamin West."</p>

<p>The melancholy maid turned round on
her clavichord stool, and as she rose to
courtesy, the color left her cheeks, for before
her stood a youth strangely like her
longed-for lover, but of a finer presence.
His eyes, hair, and nose were the same, and
when he spoke, the tones of his voice&mdash;low
and tender, like Isaac's&mdash;were as balm to her
lacerated heart.</p>

<p>It was Jonathan Morris who later in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
evening fanned the flame of Miss Shewell's
curiosity in regard to the handsome Mr.
West. He knew almost every step in the
round of the young painter's life. There
were many things he told her in regard to
his early years passed at Springfield, Delaware
County, where he did his first drawings
with colors given to him by the Indians.
How his rude paintings were the pride of
a simple Quaker community and the delight
of a mother who believed her son to be
predestined for some exalted place in the
world.</p>

<p>We can see the girl's bright eyes glisten
as she listens to the tale of the day when
the youth first left his home to journey to
the city and to fame. His father and several
neighbors accompanied him part of the
way on the Strasburg road, which was then
unsafe to travel without the protection of a
score of muskets. In those days of pioneer
life under King George the way from
Springfield township to the City of Brotherly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Love was a hazardous one, infested
with bands of brigands constantly on the
watch for travellers. As he pictures West
flying through the forest pursued by outlaws,
but at last outwitting them, her eyes
stray to the young painter, who is talking
with her sister. She views him with mingled
emotions. Brave and valiant, he dashes before
her on the charger of courage over the
rough and rocky places of life. And then
the face of Isaac Hunt comes to her mind
in the guise of a handsome weakling. Her
foolish infatuation for him is flickering and
dying. What has he ever done like this man
who has risen from a humble environment
to a figure of consequence through the force
of his own nature? The words of Morris
have succeeded in exciting her interest.</p>

<p>West feels her gaze upon him and turns
to look at her. She is wonderfully lovely in
her shimmering gown. Their eyes meet and
he goes to her. The vapors that Doctor
Franklin's music could not dispel have vanished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and in their place the lights of love
are all aglow for conquest.</p>

<p>Sarah Franklin was the life of her party
that night. She even made her mother&mdash;good
jolly home dame that few Philadelphia
fine madams would have anything to
do with&mdash;sing for the company. Perhaps
she sang the quaint song Franklin composed
for her some years after his marriage, called
"My Plain Country Joan." If she did, she
must have lingered with satisfaction over
the last verses, in which "Pappy" paid a
tribute to her worth:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Were the finest young princess with millions in purse</div>
<div class="verse1">To be had in exchange for my Joan,</div>
<div class="verse">I could not get better wife, might get worse,</div>
<div class="verse1">So I'll stick to my dearest old Joan."</div>
</div>

<p>When the company rose and gathered in
a group for the chorus, there were two who
stole out into the cool entry. They were
Betsey and West, the idealization of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
former lover. There he finished for her the
story that his early patron had begun. She
heard of his life in Italy and the admiration
his work excited. Through the great
cities of Europe she strayed with him until
they came to the small town of Reading,
where, in a watchmaker's rose-embowered
shop, his brother tinkered over fusees,
ratchet wheels, and main-springs. In his
words peace lingered along the village
street, and she sighed over the charm
of it.</p>

<p>When the chairs came the Franklin household
stood on the doorstep and wished their
guests "good-night and good rest." West
helped Miss Shewell into her sister's vehicle,
bound for Stephen Shewell's abode on
Chestnut Street, where the Bickley party
were to pass the night. After the carriers
started he followed in the chair's shadow
until he neared the alley which led to his
lodging-place; there he turned and threw
a kiss at it in the darkness. The girl's conquest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was complete. The lights of love had
burned him.</p>

<p>Betsey, seated by her sister in their slow-moving
vehicle, was silent. As they passed
the long rows of Cheapside houses, each like
its neighbor, some new memory of the evening
would come to her. Life seemed an
intangible mystery with labyrinths of intricacies.
She had found a lover strangely
like Isaac Hunt in appearance, and yet so
different. As she mounted the steps of her
four-poster a little later she almost pitied
her niece Mary.</p>

<p>Philadelphia was a gossipy place in the
days before the Revolution, and it soon became
noised abroad that the young limner
West was paying court to Betsey Shewell.
The Bickleys had retired to Penn Rhyn, but
the maiden still stayed on at her brother
Shewell's abode. This brother Shewell was
a wealthy man, following the mercantile
calling of many of his family. It is a tradition
that he desired to marry his sister to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a Water Street compatriot over twice her
age, and therefore frowned on any gentleman
whose admiration was ardent enough
to lead him to call upon her. West had
visited the fair sister several times before
the rumors of their love-affair reached his
ears. Returning one night from the Hat
Tavern, where he had business with one
Widow Cadwell, he fell in with a meddlesome
friend of Betsey's who inadvertently
told him of the tales that were floating about
the town. That a saucy nincompoop of a
painter should dare set his eyes on one of
the Shewells was a strange thing to this
arrogant gentleman whose days were bound
with buckram. Nevertheless, he resolved to
deal summarily with all parties concerned
and sift the matter to the bottom. At first
he thought of calling out West, but decided
that it would create too much scandal; besides,
although the painter's usual demeanor
was most peaceable, it was said that while in
the Lancaster militia he had become well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
skilled in the use of his sword. As he rode
homeward his anger grew at every rod the
horse covered. He scowled at the timorous
handmaiden who opened the door of his
house. His spurs beat the hard pine-wood
floor as he strode through the hall.</p>

<p>The family were seated at the evening
repast. Mrs. Shewell, a dainty, fluttering
little woman with the air of a shy wood-pigeon,
rose to greet him, but fell back in
her seat as she saw his face. Betsey glanced
at him, too. She did not quail, for she had
known her brother longer than his wife.
For a moment there was a silence awesome
as the void between two thunder-claps.
Then fury was let loose upon the room
and tore the story of a tender love-affair
from a girl's heart.</p>

<p>"Love him, dost thou? Thy chamber,
miss, is the place for thee until thy mind
mends." The man sputtered as he made to
seize the now thoroughly frightened girl.</p>

<p>The dining-room, so peaceful a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
before, became a scene of wild confusion.
Mrs. Shewell was taken with the hysterics,
the frightened handmaiden, having
entirely lost her wits, let fall a tray of India
ware she was clutching, and in the nearby
aviary a pair of Brazilian parrots set up a
screeching.</p>

<p>Through the hall and up the stairway
Stephen Shewell forced his sister, now
grown passive, and thrust her into her
chamber, locking the door from the outside.
From the landing he called in a loud voice
his orders that no one should go to her. The
tongues of the household were silent, and
quiet came after the storm.</p>

<p>Later in the night, when the hall candles
were snuffed out and the stern lord of the
mansion had fallen asleep, Mrs. Shewell
crept to the girl's door and, unfastening
the lock, stole in to give her comfort.
The room was dark and the little woman's
throat became parched as she imagined all
sorts of awful things which might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
befallen her sister-in-law. A chair gave an
unearthly creak, and she stood still, afraid
to move, when Betsey descried her and
spoke.</p>

<p>The girl was seated, fully dressed, by the
window, gazing on the sleeping city. Mrs.
Shewell approached her, and, putting her
arms about her neck, wept softly as she
thought over the past scene. Betsey kissed
her and smiled out at the night. Somewhere
off over those dim roofs just touched by a
pale moon's light he was sleeping, dreaming
of her. Over the silent streets her prayer
floated to him, where'er he was: "Oh,
Mother Night, fold your tranquil shadows
about his couch and guide his wanderings in
that wondrous land to pleasant places." Her
face was suffused with the joy of love.
They might shut her away forever behind
closed doors, but they could not destroy the
memory of the world she had found with
him.</p>

<p>Sarah Franklin was one of the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hear of Betsey Shewell's incarceration and
its cause.</p>

<p>"'Tis hard on the poor maid," she said to
her father over their morning dish. "Her
love-affairs always run amuck. First 'tis
her niece Shewell who runs away with Isaac
Hunt, and now 'tis that cock-a-spur of a
brother who shuts her away from Mr.
West."</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklin was up in arms in an instant.
"Pappy" should go at once to get
her out. The poor maid was no doubt languishing.
Then, too, 'twas well known Mr.
West was soon leaving again for foreign
countries.</p>

<p>Franklin shook his shaggy head and bent
lower over his bowl. "Would you have me
carry coals to Newcastle?" he asked. "We
must bide our time, for he that stops a little
makes an end the sooner."</p>

<p>Sarah smiled, for she knew that when her
father waxed proverbial his mind was making
a pleasant excursion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must bide our time," he repeated
again. Neither Sarah nor her mother spoke,
for they knew his mood.</p>

<p>A few hours before the Franklins began
their digression on Betsey Shewell's fate a
dark-coated figure stood before the Shewell
house and threw tiny pebbles at the third-story
chamber window where the girl slept.
There was no one on the street. The solitary
lanternman, who had laid aside his rattle
and staff, called out in a husky voice the last
"All's well and near morning," and departed.
Daylight's eyes were on the verge
of opening. Faint streaks of pink were
drawn across a sombre sky like tassels bedecking
a dull brocade. It was the wonder
hour when ghosts are creeping back to their
graves and the living are about to awake.</p>

<p>Soon a young girl appeared at the window,
opened it, and began to talk softly
with the man below. Sweet were the words
that the dawn wind caught, for the pair were
the lovers Betsey Shewell and Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
West. It was in this manner that they
sometimes saw each other. Although the
window was at too great a height for the
youth to clamber up to his ladylove or the
lady to descend to him, it still permitted
soft vows and protestations. This particular
morning West brought the sad news that
he had obtained a berth on a vessel leaving
port in a fortnight. Could she not in some
way escape from her prison? The heart of
the girl, so near and yet far away from her
lover on the pavement, beat wildly 'neath
her quilted night-robe. Vainly she longed
for the wings of a bird that she might light
by his side. For an instant there was a faint
hope, and then it was dashed away.</p>

<p>Below a window casement creaked softly.
Stephen Shewell was listening ensconced in
the folds of the chintz window-piece.
"Would thee, hussy? Would thee?" he
murmured. He could hear the voice of
West imploring his Betsey to try and fly
with him. The old crone who kept his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
lodging-place in Christ Church Alley would
secrete her until the ship left port. "Oh,
but to have the impudent fellow by the
neck!" In his rage he clenched the soft
folds of his worsted damask banyan. He
longed for something to throw,&mdash;as he ofttimes
did at the vermin of the night. Over
under the shadow curtains of the bed his wife
was waking. From a happy dream the daylight
led her eyes to her husband's face leering
out of the curtain. Knowing of the
stolen meetings, fright overcame the awe
of her husband, and she gave one piercing
shriek, prolonged and full of anguish. The
three actors in the drama each received a
shock in a different way. There was a
hurry of footsteps in the street below.
Windows rattled and opened. Grave
night-capped Quakers looked askance at
one another from house to house. What
was the matter? Inside the third-story
window of the Shewell mansion a girl
swooned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sun was high a great coach
drove away from Shewell's and took the
road for the Bickley house, Penn Rhyn,
many good leagues from the city. It carried
a pallid maid guarded by two stout
Quakeresses, servants and aides of Stephen
Shewell. The hoyden hussy was wedged
between them, disgraced and bound for the
sequestered rural shades where impecunious
painters were not.</p>

<p>Out into the wooded country the vehicle
rolled. At every jolt of the lumbering
thing the larger and stouter of the two
seized a blunderbuss from an arm-chest, in
fear of possible highwaymen. The girl between
them gave no heed to their thoughts.
Like one only half awake, she gazed out at
the country. Each field and fallow they
skirted was bearing her farther away from
him. The sweet odor of the hay-ricks, the
clouds that seemed to be racing with them,
the life of the waving trees, and the trilling
birds fluttering out of the coverts they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
brushed, all spoke of him. Each whispered
some message, she knew not what.</p>

<p>"He will never find me again," she
mused. Tears came to her eyes, and the
drops which were not to be kept back fell
on the palm of the stouter Quakeress, who
was dozing.</p>

<p>The woman opened her sleepy eyes and
gazed at her almost compassionately, then
closed them again and fell into a deep
slumber. The coach was striking level
land. Now the other Quakeress was nodding.
For a moment the girl was tempted
to seize the blunderbuss from its leather bed
and jump out into the road. Then fear
overcame her, and she, too, sank back and
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>It was the ringing of an evening bell
tolled in a nearby hamlet which welcomed
them into the beautiful roadway leading to
Penn Rhyn. That roadway is little changed
to-day, but the house itself gazes upon its
visitors in new attire. Probably there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
mansion in Pennsylvania that has had a
more interesting history than this pile
erected early in the eighteenth century by
a pompous Bickley from Buckinghamshire.
On the estate is the family tomb guarding
the dust of many generations of Bickleys&mdash;young
Bickleys who faded before their perfect
bloom, old Bickleys who were glad
enough to lay down the thread of life and
rest their tired bones on that moss-grown
bank. A long procession of men and
women bearing a name that they all were
proud of, with but one exception. He, Robert
Bickley, cursed his name and his father
one Christmas night and then threw himself
into the Delaware because the stern gentleman
had told him never to darken his door
in life, owing to an unfortunate marriage.
Now, every Christmas eve it is said that he
rises from the river, gaunt and slimy, and
steals up the path to the house. Sometimes
a belated wanderer sees him standing in the
moonlight before the great hall door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Penn Rhyn, moaning over his unhappy
fate. Again he is heard in the corridors
tapping with ghostly fingers at each chamber
door for admittance. Promptly on the
stroke of twelve weird, unearthly cries fill
the house. Then every wakeful sleeper
cuddles down low under the bedclothes.
Perhaps it is only the wind playing about
the chimneys, but the superstitious would
have us believe that it is the shade of poor
Robert Bickley calling to his young wife
and cursing his fate and name.</p>

<p>Twilight, with her many fairy couriers,&mdash;the
glowworms, fireflies, and velvety night-moths,&mdash;was
settling over the paths of
Penn Rhyn's garden when the two Quakeresses
and the girl, stiff from their long
journey, alighted before the Bickley door.
The Bickleys were overjoyed to see their
sister before brother Shewell's letter was
delivered by the stoutest of the guards, who
still carried the blunderbuss. After Abram
Bickley perused the epistle with knitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
brow an air of depression fell on the group.
"She is to stay in the country, guarded
close, for the summer, and the next summer
until this painter fellow is filched from her
head," he read to his wife.</p>

<p>The figures on the porch, with their background
of dim vines and murky bricks, made
a night-piece worthy of the brush of Mr.
Hogarth. To the girl, tired and distraught,
the front of the house seemed to be covered
with mocking faces like the masks about the
playboard of the Philadelphia theatre. She
hated them all with their looks of compassion,
scorn, and surprise. The dull-witted
Quakeresses were speaking again with her
brother-in-law. Their slow-mouthed sentences
came to her ears. "I am here like
some poor thief awaiting jail," the girl
thought, as she looked at them. Then the
faces began to fade. She had wandered
into a world of fragrant dusk filled with
the good-night prayers of closing flowers.
She would willingly go to jail for love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
There was nothing more beautiful in the
world. Each prison bar she would twine
with it. Each day and night should be
carpeted with it. Her face was raised
heavenward to the field of little stars.</p>

<p>In the course of events the world in which
the Shewells moved learned that Benjamin
West had departed for England, and that
Betsey Shewell was secreted in a safe country
retreat where it would be impossible for
him to find her. Sarah Franklin brought to
her father's mind his half promise to aid the
lovers.</p>

<p>"We must bide our time," he said.
"Haste trips up its own heels." That
night he penned a letter to West in London.
In a few months an answer came.
When "Pappy" showed it to his family
one morning, they almost devoured him
with kisses.</p>

<p>"Take me with you, father, when you set
out for Bickleys," Sarah implored. "I
want to be in the plot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"That you shall," he promised her.
"There is much to be done first, though,
for we must get at old West."</p>

<p>"'Twill be like the play, and I shall wear
my new mourning mitts," Sarah called,
pirouetting in glee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklin's face was aglow with
motherly pride. "Thou shalt wear a new
store silk, for the Bickleys be fine feathers
at home, I hear."</p>

<p>She glanced at "Pappy" for assent, but
he was deep in a newspaper. "I will get it
out of him," she said, nodding to the daughter
knowingly.</p>

</div>



<p>Betsey Shewell, who was practically a
prisoner at Penn Rhyn, so closely was she
watched, thought often of her lover in the
weary run of days. She was only allowed to
walk as far as the terrace with one of the
family or some saucy maid well aware of her
mistress's shortcoming. Her diversions were
few, and but for her cousin Betsey Bickley
she would have wasted from grief. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
her she learned of Isaac Hunt, and her lips
curved with scorn at the praise bestowed
upon him. Her niece brought the news
one day of a letter received by Abram
Bickley from over the sea. Both girls
wondered at its contents. Could it be from
West? A closer watch seemed to be kept
over the fair visitor. Many an hour they
pondered over it, surmising this and that
and wreathing it with sanguine fancies.
The suspense was becoming maddening
when all hope was dashed to the ground
by Abram Bickley, who read the communication
to his wife one morning as the four
sat in the dreary garden. It was from a
London creditor.</p>

<p>Another June was upon the land,&mdash;a wet
month more like some silly April than the
span of days loved for cheer and sunshine.
The two Betseys were out in the Bickley
garden gathering drenched roses for the
want of something better to do. All of a
sudden from the sleepy road there came the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
clatter of wheels and the clink of a slow
nag's feet. Then into view loomed a comfortable
chaise of the style afterwards
known as the "Postmaster-General." The
pair nearly dropped their budholders in the
momentary excitement. Rising from her
seat and waving a kerchief was a girl. The
face they knew well.</p>

<p>"Sarah Franklin, I do believe," called
Betsey Bickley. "Yes, yes; 'tis her father
with the reins."</p>

<p>"Pappy" and his daughter had come on
their long-promised visit to the Bickleys.
Sarah Franklin was radiant with happiness,
and it was easy to see that her father reflected
her mood. A sight to behold she was
when she descended from the side step. Her
gown, the fought-for store silk, was garnished
with a multitude of varicolored prim
flowers, and its folds tried in vain to cover
her Paris shoes with red heels, which, in lieu
of paste buckles, owing to "Pappy's" hatred
of gewgaws, she had tied with red ribbons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
On her head she wore a stiffened pasteboard
trimmed with "masqueraded bombazin" and
adorned with a waving plume which the
wind swayed like the dancer a venturesome
manager of the new theatre had put on in
the tragedy "The Orphan."</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear Betsey Shewell and Betsey
Bickley," she exclaimed, laughingly, as
she threw herself alternately in each girl's
arms. "My heart thumps at the sight of
thee!"</p>

<p>Her father smiled at her actions over his
spectacles as he added his greeting.</p>

<p>The noise of the arrival soon brought
the whole of the Bickley household to the
door.</p>

<p>"'Tis an honor, sir, to see you here,"
Abram Bickley said, as he helped Benjamin
Franklin from his seat.</p>

<p>"There is naught of an honor about it,"
Sarah Franklin whispered mockingly in
Betsey Shewell's ear. "We have come for
a play; but keep it to thyself," she added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as if afraid of her words. Then she took
off her long black mitts and twirled them in
the other's face.</p>

<p>"Won't thee make a sweet actor lady," she
said, to the other girl's wonderment, as they
walked together.</p>

<p>There were great doings at Penn Rhyn
the day the most talked of man in Philadelphia
and his daughter arrived. The largest
guest chambers were aired, the fattest goose-feather
pillows were brought out, and sweet
herbs were placed in all the chimney-piece
ornaments. Mrs. Bickley prated in a grandiloquent
manner to her maids. A statesman
on a visit to her abode gave her undisguised
pleasure.</p>

<p>The whole house was soon in a bustle.
Sarah Franklin, who sat with Betsey
Shewell on a bench in one of the fast-drying
paths near the doorway, heard
many sounds familiar to her housewifely
ears. There were the whack and thump
of duster and broom. Delicious odors soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
began to steal from the kitchen and mingle
with the scents of revived flowers.</p>

<p>"There will be a party to-morrow night,"
she said to her companion.</p>

<p>"A party!" reiterated the other in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, a party! Wait and see. 'Tis part
of the play I have writ with my father out
of our heads." Then she began to hum a
tralala. "Tell not a soul," she cautioned,
and nothing the other said could get another
word out of her.</p>

<p>When the Franklins and their travelling
chests were safely in their rooms, Sarah
opened her chamber door and went in to
her father. "She is closely watched," she
said. "Did you hint at a merry-making for
to-morrow, father?"</p>

<p>"That I did," he answered. "And now,
miss, you must lay your traps well. Tell
neither of the maids aught, for women have
restive tongues. You are proof of the
maxim. Go you to Bet Shewell's room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to-morrow and have her show you her
finery. Find out her clothes closet, and
to-morrow night, when the noise is on, creep
to her room and do them up in a bundle.
Have them ready to give her when it is time
to tell the news. To Bet Bickley say that
you have a desire to see the neighborhood
gallants, and get her to bid them all for
to-morrow night. Her father will let her
if he knows it is your hanker. Lay thy
plans well. Remember, two heads and a
goose make a market. It is a lot of trouble
we are going to for young West, and I don't
begrudge the turn; but we must not fall out
with the Bickleys."</p>

<p>The famous Miss White, of Philadelphia,
who lived to a great age, repeating reminiscences
of her cousin good Bishop White
used often to tell of that sometime gathering
given for Benjamin Franklin by the
Bickleys at Penn Rhyn. Among the guests
she always gave the names of Francis Hopkinson,
Doctor Jonathan Morris, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cousin, who was then a lad. No one ever
disputed her, and it is safe to say that the
three celebrities were there.</p>

<p>Early in the evening the neighbors began
to arrive from nearby country-seats, and the
house was soon filled with a great company,
for Mrs. Bickley wanted her world to know
of the honor being paid her. Along the
south walk each of the boxwood grotesques
was strung with little Chinese lanterns. A
bush cut in the shape of a bird held a green
dragon in the mouth. The host had planned
for a garden frolic, but a soft rain was falling.
A wit suggested that the fair ones don
capuchins and repair to the lawn for a water-nymph
dance. The drawing-room was filled
with the noise of gay badinage and the rustle
of silken garments. A female voice in an
adjoining room was trilling in languishing
strains Mr. Vernon's new Vauxhall-garden
song, "Jenny and Chole." Between the
notes one could catch the fretful murmur of
the rain. Its patter on the catalpa leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
near the windows was like the protestations
of some band of elfin children angry at the
death of moonlit hours and lost playtimes.</p>

<p>To all observers Franklin was in his gayest
mood, and repeated funny tales and
made frequent jests; his daughter also
laughed with all the gentlemen surrounding
her. But in reality their hearts were
both heavy. Betsey Shewell was upstairs
locked in her chamber, and their long-cherished
plan of setting her free seemed
worsted, for a servant sat guard by the
door.</p>

<p>Outside at the back of the house, hidden
by a clump of bushes, the father of Benjamin
West was waiting patiently for the lady
who was to fly with him to England. Some
distance from the Bickley grounds his rowboat
that was to bear them to a frigate at
Chester was moored to a bank. The night
was far advanced and his old limbs were
quaking from the cold rain. His eyes,
resting on the house, saw a candle flash from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
an upper window. He knew that it must be
a signal.</p>

<p>Sarah Franklin, as soon as she discovered
the way the wind blew, began, at her father's
instigation, quietly to take goodies from the
dining-room up to the servant by the door.</p>

<p>"I can't let you give them to her, miss,"
the woman said when the girl first approached.</p>

<p>"They are not for Betsey, but for yourself,"
Sarah answered. "You must be tired
watching. I thought you would like some
cheer," she added artfully.</p>

<p>Fate aided the conspirator, for it chanced
that the woman was a glutton, and she drank
eagerly of the huge jug of stiff punch. She
was snoring blissfully when Sarah again
came up to her. Slipping her hand into the
other's apron pocket, she found the door-key.
On tiptoe she crept to the door and,
turning the lock, opened it a few inches
and went in very softly, bolting it on the
inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>A night-lamp was burning on a wall-piece
and Betsey Shewell did not shriek, as Sarah
feared she might, on her entrance. She was
dressed and lying on a sofa listening to the
sounds of mirth from below. She had been
pondering over Sarah's strange words of the
morning and the day before, and their meaning
was now dawning on her. The Franklins
were going to help her to escape from
Penn Rhyn.</p>

<p>The girl, in disordered party finery, seized
a candle from a stand, lit it over the lamp,
and held it before the window. Betsey
Shewell ran to her and began to clutch at
her skirts, unnerved at the glorious thoughts
of freedom.</p>

<p>"Hist!" the other said, touching her lips.
"West's father comes across the lawn."</p>

<p>Both girls had mounted the sill and were
motioning to the man below, who was
placing a ladder before the window. Betsey
began to sob in her excitement.</p>

<p>"I cannot go! I cannot go!" she wailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah shook her companion gently as she
drew a heavy hooded cape about her head.</p>

<p>"Hush! Hush!" she murmured. "Do
you want to wake the woman by the door?
Your lover longs for you in London Town
and my father and I want to get thee to
him. There is no time to stop now for your
things," she added. "Part of the play I
prated of is ruined, for we did not count on
your being shut up here to-night." She was
losing her breath and the din downstairs
seemed to be lessening. "Go! go!" she said.</p>

<p>For a moment the girls were clasped in
each other's arms. "I can ne'er repay your
goodness," one of them said. From the
other's eyes flashed all manner of sweet
wishes.</p>

<p>"Go!" she whispered again hoarsely.
"Good that is too late is as good as nothing."
She was smiling alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>Off into the night floated the murmur of
convivial voices in bibulous cadence. Now
the great Franklin was laughing. A watchful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ear could catch the patter of faint footsteps.</p>

<p>Outside the room the servant still snored
by the door. Sarah passed her safely and
replaced the key. No one was ever the wiser
for the part she and her father had played
in West's life until she told it herself in later
years.</p>

<p>Down to the river an old man and a girl
stole through the darkness. Off to an unknown
land it bore them to bask in the sunshine
of a laurel-strewn pathway the painter
Benjamin West knew through a long and
fruitful life.</p>

<p>Recently one of his old letters to Doctor
Jonathan Morris was brought to light, written
four years after his marriage to Betsey
Shewell, on September 2, 1765, in the church
of St. Martin's in the Fields. It breathes
of peace and contentment, and when that
worthy read it to the Franklin household,
there was one who sighed over its sentiments,
and another, alas! over the spelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="bq">

<p>A great red brick mansion in Chambers
Street, guarded by two sentinel-like elm-trees
and a tall iron fence; a sidewalk filled
with the fashionables of Gotham starting
for the afternoon Battery promenade; and
up behind the eye-like panes of one of the
haughty, staring windows a maiden dreaming
over her pen. There is the picture. A
demure little country Phyllis, visiting her
august city relatives for the first time, has
found herself in two strange worlds&mdash;fashion
and love. In the extract taken
from her letter written to a home confidante
is the key to a forgotten romance
of old New York. Love! the key to all
the romances since the world began. "He
loves me," she writes, the time-worn phrase
every true daughter of Eve has hoped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
whisper to herself or cry out to the multitudes,
and we feel the thrill of those faded
but impassioned words as in imagination we
open the gates of that old-time mansion and
enter into the year of 1807.</p>

<p>New York society, which seems to undergo
a complete revision every quarter of
a century, has entirely changed since the
name of Moore meant as much to the metropolis
as that of Biddle to Philadelphia or
Carroll to Baltimore. At the time of which
I write, when the first numbers of the "Salmagundi
Papers" were startling North
River aristocrats, fields lay beyond the new
St. John's Church, and Canal Street was
looked upon by the sagacious as the probable
Mecca for retail commerce. Jeremy
Cockloft, the younger, gives us a glimpse
of the residence portion of the city in "The
Stranger at Home, or a Tour of Broadway."
"Broadway&mdash;great difference in the
gentility of streets; a man who resides in
Pearl-Street, or Chatham-Row, derives no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
kind of dignity from his domicile, but place
him in a certain part of Broadway&mdash;anywhere
between the Battery and Wall-Street,
and he straightway becomes entitled to figure
in the beau monde, and struts as a person
of prodigious consequence."</p>

<p>In the new Chambers Street, named after
one of Trinity's vestrymen, was the home
of Dr. William Moore, then the first physician
of old New York. With a wife who
was a daughter of Nathaniel Fish, and a
brother, the Right Reverend Benjamin
Moore, D.D., Bishop of the Protestant
Episcopal Church in the State of New
York and Rector of Trinity Church, his
right to dose the aristocratic element of the
city was undisputed. It is small wonder
that his morning parlor was generally filled
with patients who, tradition says, sometimes
literally fought for admission into the inner
room and the presence of their "dear gentlemanly
doctor."</p>

<p>William Moore was a physician of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
school, and is remembered as wearing a bob-tailed
wig and wrist ruffles long after the
fashion was obsolete. No doubt this adherence
to the costume of a past <i>r&eacute;gime</i> gave
him an additional hold over many of his
patrons. Legion were the antique dames
struggling against the invasion of demoralizing
French fashions who derived momentary
satisfaction watching him amble to the
family pew in Trinity, followed by numerous
exponents of that scapegrace, Napoleon's
Empire.</p>

<p>Dr. William Moore, of Chambers Street!
A long-dead king of pills and potions. How
stern looks the old figure in the bottle-green
coat the name conjures up! We can hear
the voice of Thomas, the negro valet, call
out, "Dis way to de Dochtar's sanctum,
missy or madam." "Not you thar, ladies,"
as the circle rises. Many a humble possessor
of a backache or a heartache must have
trembled before that roomful of Cr&oelig;sus's
children on hearing a summons to the awesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
presence. Just over the office a
maiden sat one spring afternoon in the
glow of a love-dream. She heard the dull
murmur below, but her thoughts were too
beautiful to heed an interlude so closely
allied to pain. Through the garden gates
the people passed in and out, and now and
then the voice of Thomas would come floating
to her with his "Dis way to de Dochtar's
sanctum." Little did she imagine, as she
bent over her pen, that she would ever be
called there and the closing door shut out her
love-dream forever.</p>

<div class="caption">NATHANIEL FISH MOORE</div>
</div>

<p>Two years before Ellen Conover, the girl
of the picture, first came to town a youth
had journeyed to her home, Federal Hall,
in Monmouth County, New Jersey, on a
visit. He was Nathaniel Fish Moore, the
son of Dr. Moore. The time was a college
vacation, for the young man was a student
at Columbia, the institution so closely associated
with the Moore name. Mrs. Conover
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Anna Fish, his mother's twin sister, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
proud of her handsome and high-spirited
nephew, and encouraged his intimacy with
her sons and daughters.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of Marlboro, where Federal
Hall lifted its white head above the low
stretches of verdant country, Ellen first met
the youth who was to be her future lover.
When the great coach rounded the turnpike
curve with rumbles and groans, and the
foam-flecked horses were becoming mere
specks in the gray distance, did any of that
merry party realize that in the infrangible
twilit silence of an early summer's eve
two kindred souls had found each other?
Up the hilly meadow whose multitude of
young green things seem awed at the shadowy
approach of night the family trudges,
followed by slaves carrying the horse-hair
trunks! What a peaceful pastoral scene it
is! The spring and all her delicate children
are dead, and in her place have come the
thousand charms of happier summer. We
hear the mother's tender voice, the father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
deep tones, and now and then the eager
questions of the boy as he helps the maiden
through tangles and over stones. The arms
of the darkness are encircling them and
shutting them away. Soon they will reach
that great hall door which no longer guards
the welcoming glow of a high-piled hearth.
Before it every year the summer comes and
goes. The flowers creep up to it, the wind
and the rain sigh against it, but the old-time
lovers long ago joined the silent company in
God's immutable garden of rest.</p>

<p>Freehold, the next town to Marlboro,
was the county-seat and the resort of a
gentry which closely modelled itself after
the country families of England. Racing,
hunting, shooting, and fishing then comprised
a large part of the sum of existence
for the Jersey squire. Every great landowner
possessed a small army of slaves, and
the wheels of life ran smoothly. Heavy
silver flagons were on the oaken sideboards,
old port and sherry in Mammy Dinah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
cellaret, and a strong box overflowing with
gold pieces was secreted somewhere behind
the <i>Spectators</i> on the library shelves. On
the yellow road creeping out from the court-house
stood half a hundred happy Jersey
homes&mdash;Battle Hill, Violet Bank, Cincinnati
Hall, Forman Place, Mount Pleasant
Hall, Wassung Vale, Shipley, Harmony
Hall, Haven Home, Lover's Port. Only a
few of them are left to-day. Mornings
spent in following the hounds through dewy
coverts, afternoons in spinning or visiting,
and evenings in dancing or reading Goldsmith
with some favored companion in the
englenook by the hall fire composed the daily
and nightly curriculum that Ellen Conover
and the Jersey girls of her class knew.</p>

<p>It is said that the portrait of Ellen Conover,
by the elder Jarvis, in a white empire
gown against a dull pink background, was
more like a caricature of her than a faithful
rendering of her charms. Her eyes were
deep blue, her hair of a gold-brown color,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and her complexion had that fresh soft tint
only to be compared to wild roses. Clement
Moore, a son of Bishop Moore, who wrote
"'Twas the Night before Christmas," a
poem which has delighted so many generations
of children, used to dwell with rapture
on the beauty of her arms and neck. He
was one of the gay young city sparks who
looked with favor on the little country girl
when she first appeared in town, and lost his
heart in the bargain, too, if tradition does
not err. This we know, that the Knickerbocker
belles were palling upon him at that
period, and his muse hurled fiery diatribes at
the modish nakedness of his young country-women.</p>

<p>After the stately dinners were over in the
Moore mansion, and the hour for stray patients
past, the parlors became scenes of
revelry. Eight o'clock was then the usual
calling time in the city, and when the voice
of the old clock had finished welcoming in
that portion of the evening dear to feminine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hearts, Thomas had answered the knock of
many a beau. These were the good old days
when jolly Colonel Marinus Willet, the
city's mayor, was the model of every smooth-faced
buck, and sweet Anne Bankhead,
coming to town with her fair tresses arranged
in the Paris mode resembling the
comb of a rooster, started a fashion which
made the fortune of the "Empereur des
Barbieres Frizzing Palace on de Brudeway."
We know the names of many of
the Moore girls' callers. Among the favored
were Henry Major, who married
Jane Moore on August 2, 1808, in St.
John's Church, still standing on Varick
Street. Then there was Henry de Rham,
who married her sister Maria; John Titus,
engaged in business with Mr. Major; John
Swartwout, the loyal friend of Colonel
Burr; Theodore Frelinghuysen, and many
others.</p>

<p>On the Orleans claw-footed sofas, then
humiliated by chintz covering depicting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Corsican's bees, the Misses Moore would sit
with their swains. There were four of these
ponderous pieces of furniture in the large
room, so that there was never any danger
of crowding. We can picture to ourselves
Ellen and her lover taking part in the gayety
and longing to be by themselves in
some quieter spot. In Monmouth her
heart would not tell her that she loved
him, but here she had discovered the sweet
secret.</p>

<p>How beautiful was their blossoming love-dream!
No doubt, after Thomas crept down
to the servants' quarters to bed and the hall
was deserted, they often stole away from the
company, opened the massive mahogany
door, and gazed off over the patch of garden
into the night. Only the garden knew of
their first kisses,&mdash;the nesting birds and the
drowsy flowers. They always seem to keep
an eye open for human lovers. The robins
and the bluebirds chirp sadly, and the
flowers give forth fragrant sighs just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
if they knew that the course of "true love
never runs smooth."</p>

<p>Under the little beech-tree, with his arm
about her, he told her of the humble home
he hoped to rent in Gansevoort Street when
she would say "Yes." He would not be
dependent on his father. His office down
on Nassau Street was no longer always deserted.</p>

<p>"I will bring mammy from the country,"
she would whisper. "And Ned."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," he would answer.</p>

<p>"I shall cook the breakfast for you with
my own hands every morning."</p>

<p>Little white hands. How he pressed
them!</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful just to be here together?"
her lips would falter, as if afraid
of the words.</p>

<p>Poor little old-time lovers! Poor little
fluttering hearts! There are steps on the
pavement outside the gates, for the watch
have started on the weary walk with night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The Moore girls who decorously occupied
the Orleans sofas all through the calling
hours soon began to notice the couple who
so often left the circle. In the morning at
the breakfast-table there were often sly innuendoes
that Dr. Moore, absorbed in his
<i>Herald</i>, never paid any attention to and
Mrs. Moore could not understand. She
would have, though, if she had observed the
burning roses in a maiden's cheeks and the
angry eyes of the youth opposite glaring at
his tormentors.</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, did you observe the new moon
last night?" Jane Moore would innocently
ask. "Ellen, you must have." Then how
they would giggle.</p>

<p>"Hush, girls!" Mrs. Moore would say as
she poised her Wedgwood coffee-cup and
gazed around the table. "Young ladies in
your station of life should never laugh so
loudly; it is not genteel."</p>

<p>Some of the young fellows who called at
the house were not so observing as the Moore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
girls. Freddy Frelinghuysen used to try
and keep the pretty country cousin by his
side on one of the sofas when the sparking
hour was on. Captain William Montgomery,
just home from the West Indies, professed
open admiration for a New York
maiden who could spin.</p>

<p>"If you will spin me a shirt in an afternoon
like the girls in Melrose used to make
I will give you the handsomest lace dress to
be found in the city," he once said.</p>

<p>"Agreed," she answered. "And if I fail
I will give you the finest dress suit a tailor
can make."</p>

<p>You may be sure that the proud sister-in-law
of a bishop never heard of this wager.
The girls kept it a secret.</p>

<p>"It is not anything, after all," Jane said
to her sisters. "Ellen not being town bred,
it will exonerate her."</p>

<p>Ned did not like the idea very much, but
Ellen seemed so delighted at the chance to
show her skill that he did not have the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to dampen her pleasure with a lecture on the
improprieties.</p>

<p>"I must remember that she is a bloom of
the fresh free countryside, where life is
broader and less restrained by convention,"
he said to himself. So Ellen was left to win
her wager with happiness.</p>

<p>One morning Mrs. Moore announced
from behind the George III. coffee-urn
bearing the arms of the Fish family that
she had decided to give a ball. "As the
wife of a physician and the sister of a
bishop, I feel it my duty to do something
for society. Not a bread-and-butter affair
like old Mrs. Hone gives; nor should I care
to entertain the mob of vulgarians Mrs. Van
Pelt does. Something elegant for the representative
families, William," she said, giving
her spouse's coffee-cup a conciliatory
dash of cream.</p>

<p>"Oh, you lovely, lovely mamsey!" the
Moore girls chorus. "No, we can't sit still,"
they cry, heedless of her admonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
About the table they pirouette and out into
the hall, almost knocking over the haughty,
stout Miss Rattlebones whom Thomas is
leading to the doctor's office.</p>

<p>"Won't it be simply perfect?" they keep
asking Ellen. "We will have the waltz,&mdash;the
new dance so fashionable abroad, you
know."</p>

<p>"And 'The Devil among the Tailors'
they had at Matilda Hoffman's the other
night," Jane added.</p>

<p>"The what? The devil something do I
hear you say?" asks Mrs. Moore, rolling
her eyes in a horrified fashion. "We
will never have that indecent dance in my
abode."</p>

<p>What happy days followed Mrs. Moore's
announcement, with the hundred things to
be planned and finished! Every gallant who
shared the Orleans sofas with the Misses
Moore during those evenings before the
great event was asked whether he preferred
white or blue bunting for the parlor ceiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Did he like the idea of pink roses in the
Nast vases on the chimney-piece? Could he
imagine the room lighted by five hundred
candles? Wasn't it shocking that mother
was contemplating serving five kinds of
punch? The parlor was becoming a huge
question mark and the Moore ball the talk
of the city.</p>

<p>Ellen and her lover shared in all the preparations
for the affair, but very often they
stole out to their trysting-spot of an evening
to be alone.</p>

<p>The fateful night before the ball the Argus
eyes of Mrs. Moore descried them from
her bedroom window seated under their favorite
beech-tree. At first she thought the
figures were Jane and Mr. Major. Then,
blowing out her candle, the cruel spring
starlight helped her to make out the forms
of Nathaniel and Ellen. Like one fascinated,
she watched them. The wind blew
the silver leaves of the beech-tree and she
learned their secret. He had kissed her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
"Oh, it is dreadful!" she whispered to herself,
murmuring like one who has received
a shock. "They are first cousins. My Nathaniel
loves her. I have been blind." The
memory of the bantering words passed at
table came back to her with a new meaning.
Why, only the other day William, her
younger son, had told her that Nathaniel
was in Brooke's getting the rents of Gansevoort
Street houses. The ball had driven
everything else from her mind. The affair
must be broken off at once. She would seek
William.</p>

<p>Doctor Moore was seated by a hickory-wood
fire in an adjoining apartment, ensconced
in a flowered chintz dressing-gown.
The bustle of preparation for the past few
days had annoyed him, but the spirit of
peace now seemed to have found a place in
the wide firelit room. A negress was passing
a warming-pan lightly over the lavender-scented
sheets of the high four-poster. It
was an old-fashioned winter custom that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
doctor demanded all through the spring.
The air was filled with the dreamy scents of
lavender and the pungent odor of the hickory
boughs. The fire made the tired man
close his eyes, and the ponderous medical
treatise dropped to the floor. Morpheus was
wooing him when the startling figure of
Mrs. Moore, with her nightcap awry and
her hair falling over her shoulders, entered
the room, bringing him back to the world
he was trying to forget. The walls of the
old room heard sad things that night.
Young hearts that had blossomed out like
twin buds on a stem were to be torn asunder.
Their little beech-tree in the garden seemed
to be aware of impending disaster, and the
dreary sighing of its leaves suddenly fell
upon the two by the fire. The night was
nearly dead.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, after all, Jane, we have been
premature with our worrying and there is
nothing between them," the weary father
said. "I will see Nathaniel in the morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Now go to bed, dear; you know to-morrow
is your ball, and that will bring you many
duties."</p>

<p>The mystical to-morrow. Like some wan
and beggared guest, it tapped on the panes
of the great Moore mansion. The cold
starlight had not fulfilled its promise, and
the face of the day was old before the world
was up to see it. Outside the Moore gates
it was all gray mist, and yet many of the
household looked at it happily. The cooks
sang as they worked over the breakfast by
candle-light. In a week's time they had
prepared a roomful of good things for the
children of pleasure to eat that night.</p>

<p>Thomas chuckled gleefully as he showed
his new red-and-gold party livery to the
company below stairs. He knew that he
was a very handsome nigger, and many a
lady's maid would smile at him as she followed
her mistress through the hall when
the ball commenced. None of the ladies appeared
at breakfast, and after the last dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was removed Doctor Moore asked Nathaniel
to follow him to the office.</p>

<p>"Nathaniel," the father said, motioning
his son to a seat, "your mother saw your
conduct in the garden last night with Miss
Conover, and I wish to know its meaning."</p>

<p>The young man had refused to be seated,
and stood by one of the windows gazing out
into the mist. The grayness filled him with
a vague intimation of approaching trouble.
Ellen's name was its first sense of realization.
"I love Miss Conover," he answered,
almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>The old physician in the stiff-backed desk-chair
knit his brow and pulled his stock up
higher about his throat, an action familiar to
his patients. He seemed lost in thought. In
front of him was his desk covered with
medicine phials, but here was a case that no
medicine he could give would help.</p>

<p>"My son," he said, and the clock accentuated
the huskiness of his voice. "My son,
you have no right to love Miss Conover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
She is your first cousin, and you can never
marry her. It is a hopeless love."</p>

<p>"Other men have married their cousins,
sir. There are Jonathan Kortright and
Hulda Reid, and Chauncey Prince&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Nathaniel," the doctor's voice interrupted
his passionate speech, "the world
is full of law-breakers; but it is the edict
of God that two of one flesh cannot marry.
I should never countenance such a union.
Your children would be accursed."</p>

<p>The glowing eyes of the young man were
riveted on those older eyes drooping beneath
the gray wig. Why didn't he storm and
rage as he used to in the old days when a
lad in torn nankeens and begrimed face was
brought to that desk like a culprit before a
tribunal of justice? He could see that his
father pitied him. In the next room they
were tacking up the wall decorations for the
ball, and a monotonous tap, tap was joined
to the maddening ticking of the clock.</p>

<p>Suddenly the youth rose to his full height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
before the old man and caught his weary
eyes. "I shall marry her," he said. "I defy
you, God, or the devil to stop me!"</p>

<p>The wrinkled, passive face before him
seemed dazed and blurred. There was no
answer. Oh, how cold and dreary the room
looked! Life, after all, held very little.
The fire died out in the youth's eyes. "My
God, what a hell you have given me!" he
cried. There was a knock at the door and
the father rose to open it. In the middle of
the floor he stopped and went up to his son.
Upon the strong young arms he placed his
feeble hands. "Be a brave man, my son,"
he said. "May God help you!"</p>

<p>In her aunt's room overhead Ellen was
humming an air she remembered Miss Trelawny
singing a week before at the Park,
when Nathaniel had given a gay little
theatre party to celebrate the winning of
Captain Montgomery's gown. It had arrived
only that morning from Madame
Bouchard's on Cortlandt Street, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
black maid had spread it on a bed where
the young ladies could admire it. Very beautiful
were its soft folds of Machlin lace.</p>

<p>"You will be more like a partner of the
fashionable Madame Moreau than a country
girl to-night," Jane Moore told Ellen, as she
and her sisters hurried off to deliver some
of their mother's orders.</p>

<p>"Watch Ned's eyes, Jane, when he first
sees her," Maria whispered, as she closed the
bedroom door softly.</p>

<p>Ellen gazed out into the street. The mist
was rising. Perhaps, after all, it would be
a clear night. Through the gates came a
ceaseless stream of flower men and women
carrying wicker baskets piled high with early
blooms; Fly-Market dealers with bundles of
provisions; Mrs. Leach and some of the
girls from the Broadway Frozen Cream
Parlor to make the sherbets and syllabubs.
A group of urchins and older busybodies
were standing in the middle of the street
gazing up at the windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be grand to be rich and give
parties like them foine birds," a chimney-sweep's
wife remarked to the woman next
to her.</p>

<p>"Now, don't ye envy them, miss," her
companion replied. "Ye never can tell
when ye look at a big house what's hiding
behind the velvets afore the windows."</p>

<p>The grim Pompeys on the gates seemed
to smile at her logic. And yet, after all, the
darkness overhead was breaking away, and
from out the sombre clouds the sky was
spilling pale new-born sunshine over roofs
and steeples and despairing streets.</p>

<p>Those who heard of the glories of the
Moore ball in their youth are not likely
ever to forget it: the music, the supper, the
graciousness of host and hostess, and the
company. There was a new Astor piano borrowed
from the bishop to mingle its fresh
voice with that of the tired Moore spinet and
the playing of the Park's four violinists.
The people who attended it, whose names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
were as well known then as the pure tones
of Trinity's bells,&mdash;Le Roys, Rutgers,
Gouverneurs, Beekmans, Jays, de Lanceys,
Wilcoxes, Livingstons, Kissams, Kortrights,
Clarksons, Schermerhorns, Van Pelts,
Clarks, Varicks, Waddingtons, Van Santvoorts,
Van Nests, Pells, Kembles, Fairlees,
and Waters,&mdash;they were the great of
1807.</p>

<p>In the largest parlor, where the Orleans
sofas are pushed ignominiously against the
wall, youthful New York is whirling about
to the strains of the Corporal Listnor waltz.
Two belles of the evening the room contains,&mdash;Maria
Mayo, of Virginia and New
Jersey, who married General Winfield
Scott, and Matilda Hoffman, the love of
gay young Washington Irving. A third,
and the most remarked of all that large company,&mdash;Ellen
Conover,&mdash;has just passed
through the doorway on the arm of Nathaniel
Moore. A handsome couple they
make,&mdash;she in her lace gown and he in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dark plum-colored evening clothes. She is
smiling, for she does not see the look of
misery in his eyes.</p>

<p>"The stars are out, dear; shall we go into
the garden and sit under our own little
beech-tree?" she asks.</p>

<p>Our beech-tree! How the words sink into
his soul and cut like knives!</p>

<p>"No, Ellen," he answers; "the leaves of
the tree, so tender and young, are old and
seared for us."</p>

<p>"Why, Nathaniel, how strange you talk!"
she says. Then she looks into his white face
and begins to understand.</p>

<p>Oh, the anguish of his drawn young face,
as he folds her in his arms and tells her to
be brave. Into the library she follows him.
Her step has lost its buoyancy and the roses
have died in her cheeks. A woman's intuition
has guessed what he has to tell her.
Something has come between them. Softly
he closes the door on the lights, the music,
and the babble of happy voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kiss me and never let me speak again,
darling," he whispers. But she lets him
speak&mdash;and break her heart.</p>

<p>Almost a century has passed since the
dawn after the Moore ball when a girl stole
down the slender staircase of that proud
mansion. It was Ellen Conover garbed for
a journey. Like the ghost of pleasure, she
crept through the trellis-work of faded
flowers which adorned the landing and hurried
noiselessly over the slippery hall. No
one was about but Thomas, who was picking
up some of the motto papers and dead
flowers strewn over the dining-room floor.
Hearing the rustle of a woman's dress, he
came to the door of that room and looked
out with startled eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, missy, is you going abroad so
early?" he asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom, I'm going back to Monmouth."</p>

<p>Seeing a question in his eyes, she continued,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt will understand. I have left a
note by her door."</p>

<p>In her hand she held a square deerskin
bag, and the negro, not forgetting his manners
in his bewilderment, asked whether he
could carry it for her.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Tom," she said, wearily, as he
relieved her of the heavy burden. "Colonel
Montgomery is to be at the Broadway corner
for me. He is going to Englishtown, and
has promised to see me home. The Paulus
Hook coach passes at seven, you know."</p>

<p>Beside the lyre-shaped hat-rack Ellen
paused for a moment. Thomas thought
that she was going to faint, but she beckoned
for him to go on. Before her was
Nathaniel's gray beaver, the one she had
liked him in so much. She remembered he
wore it that happy day they wandered down
to Gansevoort Street to look at their little
dream-house. Dear dream-house, that would
never be theirs. The wistaria vine that
twined so lovingly about the stoop-rail high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
up to the dormer window would never
purple for them. Was he asleep now?
She wondered what he would think of her
running off in this fashion. "Perhaps it is
foolish, but I could never stand seeing him
again," she murmured to herself. On the
floor were his riding-gloves, swept off the
hat-rack by some heedless reveller of the
night before. Like one lingering in a
dream, she picked them up and tenderly
put them in the pocket of her coat. For
a moment she stood silent with her hand on
the door in the attitude of one listening to
a benediction. Outside a soughing wind
was sweeping through the deserted street
and the dark hall was full of its whispered
sighs. Softly she opened the door on the new
day, and then, as if speaking to an invisible
presence, she said, "May you sometimes
think of me as I shall always think of you,
dear heart." And the sweetest part of the
story is, he was faithful to her memory until
death.</p>

<p class="tch">A True Picture of the Last Days of Aaron Burr</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">A</span>N old house that has fallen to ruin
always has something pathetic about
it, but a great hostelry in the clutches of decay,
where warmth and cheer have welcomed
generations of travellers, is sadder still. In
Port Richmond, Staten Island, there is still
standing the Richmond Inn, suffering from
the weight of many years. Erected before
the war of 1812, until 1820 it was the home
of the Mersereau family, who owned most
of the surrounding land when the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bore the name of Mersereau's Ferry. The
Mersereaus were Huguenots, and descended
from two brothers who fled with their
mother from France to America on the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The
Richmond Inn rests on the site of an earlier
Mersereau mansion,&mdash;a witness of the Revolution.
During the early part of the last
century there were no buildings to shut off
the view of the water-front, and its lawn ran
down to a bluff overlooking the ferry landing
and wharf. There Jed Simonson, a soldier
who had fought at Monmouth, received
the freight from the Jersey shore and the
chance scow bearing Indian luxuries purchased
from the hold of some newly-arrived
merchantman. Great trees stood guard at
the back of the inn like a troop of shadowy
sentinels, and through them came sweet
scents of the verdant country that rolled
away over the British breastworks still
covering the nearby hills. On the wide galleries
of this haven of rest old sea-captains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
could always be seen gently dozing as they
puffed long pipes in the sunlight, or perchance
gazing through spy-glasses at the
white sails flecking the harbor. The ocean
underwent quick transitions as they rounded
Cape Hatteras or struck the Gulf Stream,
and the nautical yarns they spun of the
"Merry Marys," "Saucy Belles," and
"Swift Sallys" were ropes which led to the
seamen's true Elysium.</p>

<p>At nightfall the mail-coach often drove
up before the door with a load of happy
guests and bore others away. Those were
the days when social intercourse was a feature
of tavern life. "Good-by! Good-by!"
a dozen feminine voices would call as the
gay party of Southerners departed on their
long journey to Baltimore. Toasts of Calverts
and St. Marys, tears and kisses and
fluttering handkerchiefs before the coach
rumbled past the little red general store
into the darkness. And then later in the
evening, when it was time for the candles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the young people remaining would assemble
in the hall for a reel, made merrier by the
jingly protests of the gold-legged Clementi
piano. It was to this abode that Aaron
Burr, world-weary and near death, was
brought in 1836.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">

<div class="caption"> ON THE WIDE GALLERIES OF THIS HAVEN OF REST OLD SEA-CAPTAINS
COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN GENTLY DOZING AS THEY PUFFED LONG PIPES
IN THE SUNLIGHT</div>
</div>

<p>Aaron Burr, the courageous, was then
sunk into an abyss so low that his enemies
should have been satisfied. For years he had
endured the censure of his fellows, the vituperation
of Federalists and anti-Federalists,
and the sneers of the populace without a
murmur. Like the rock depicted on the old
seal with which he used to stamp his letters,
his lofty spirit had been unmoved by the
winds and waves of public opinion. But
now disease and old age had found him, and
the spectre every human thing must some
day face was his relentless pursuer. Until
recently there was one living who remembered
his arrival at the old hostelry. How
the black stage-driver and a gentleman of
the party assisted him up the steps to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
door and then up the quaint staircase to the
largest guest-room on the second floor. The
spot is still shown where stood the ancient
curtained bed he occupied. The wide, white
carved mantel-piece where his tired eyes must
have often rested has not been disturbed, and
one of the old window-panes bears the sentence,
scratched with a diamond, "All is
vanity," which tradition says is his work.</p>

<p>Aaron Burr's career is a strange record of
triumphs almost reached; the picture of a
proud spirit tortured and frenzied by fate.
The story has been handed down from generation
to generation in the Edwards family,
and is preserved among the papers of the
late William Paterson, of Perth Amboy,
that when Aaron Burr was an infant in the
parsonage on Broad Street, Newark, his
mother often prayed that her son should
be as a star among men. Her prayer was
answered, but not in the way she would have
wished. From his mother Burr inherited
that morbid sensitiveness which eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
proved his downfall. Esther Edwards never
forgot some of the stings she had endured
when painting fans in the manner of Watteau
for the fashionable women of Boston.
Her son always believed that Alexander
Hamilton was the cause of his ruin in the
eyes of Washington, the loss of the Presidency
of the United States, and the constant
blackener of his good name by tongue and
pen. If the shadow of Hamilton had never
crossed the path of Burr, the latter's name
might have been glorious for all time.</p>

<p>In the Paterson papers on Princeton College,
recently published under the title
"Glimpses of Colonial Society and the Life
at Princeton College, 1766-1773," we find
recorded that "little Burr" was one of
the most popular men of his class at "The
College of New Jersey." "To see you shine
as a Speaker would give great pleasure to
your friends in general and to me in particular.
You certainly are capable of making
a good Speaker, dear Burr," that noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
youth, William Paterson, wrote to him when
leaving Princeton in 1772. Through Paterson
we learn that Burr would go any length
to serve a friend, wrote in a lady-like hand,
and at sixteen was the admiration of the fair
sex of Elizabethtown. This comrade and a
few other of the jolly founders of the Cliosophic
Society were the subjects of Burr's
reminiscences in those last summer days
when the sea-air stealing through his windows
seemed to give him new life. The
horrible nightmare of his later years was
forgotten. He was a boy again at the little
village of Princeton that his father loved,
the sun shone on proud Nassau Hall, the
Scotch silversmiths tinkered all day long in
the shops lengthening the Main Street, the
lights glowed in the tavern, and fair Betsy
Stockton was the belle and toast of the College.</p>

<p>Almost every stage of Aaron Burr's life
is tinged with melodramatic interest, and it
is fitting that the woman who befriended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
him in his last years should have been the
daughter of a British soldier met on the
battle-field of Quebec. There Burr saw
the gallant Richard Montgomery and his
own college-mate, John Macpherson, stain
the snow with their blood, and it is a disputed
tradition that Burr carried the wounded
Montgomery from the field. The name of
the generous soul who cared for him after
his disastrous marriage with Madame Jumel
and subsequent removal from Mrs. Hedden's
house in Paulus Hook was Mrs.
Joshua Webb. It has been written that
she kept a boarding-house in the old Jay
mansion, a proud dwelling in New York's
history, and sheltered her father's friend at
the risk of fortune and reputation. Madame
Jumel, towards the close of her life, used to
relate that she offered him pecuniary aid at
that period, but it was proudly refused.</p>

<p>In his basement room at Mrs. Webb's,
propped up in bed by his faithful black
servant Kester, or Keaser, as the name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sometimes written, Burr received his old
friends. There John Vanderlyn, the youth
from Kingston whom he befriended, and
who became a famous painter, celebrated
for his "Marius," would visit him; there,
too, came Judge Ogden Edwards, then residing
in the Dongan manor-house at West
New Brighton, Colonel Richard Conner,
and a few other faithful ones whose names
are unrecorded. The portrait of his lost
Theodosia, who stands forth in history as
the noblest of daughters, hung in front of
the bed. Through the window he could
obtain glimpses of familiar streets where
he had once walked with his wife, Theodosia
Prevost, the lovely niece of the eccentric
Thomas Bartow, of Amboy. But they
were changing. The abode on Maiden
Lane, his first New York house, was destroyed,
and the larger mansion at the corner
of Nassau and Cedar Streets was also
gone. Richmond Hill, one of the most
beautiful country-seats in New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
where, in her fourteenth year, Theodosia
presided over her father's board and conversed
with the greatest men of the day,
was then covered by Varick Street, and St.
John's Park, which was in the beginning of
its glory. At the little Maiden Lane house
his wife had penned him many of her beautiful
letters. Her ghost must have often
come before him as he read over the faded
epistle written one stormy night after he had
left her for New Jersey, in which she outpoured
for him her ardent love:</p>


<div class="bq">
<p>"Thus pensive, surrounded by gloom, thy Theo
sat, bewailing thy departure. Every breath of
wind whistled terror; every noise at the door was
mingled with hope of thy return, and fear of thy
perseverance, when Brown arrived with the word&mdash;embarked&mdash;the
wind high and the water rough.
Heaven protect my Aaron; preserve him, restore
him to his adoring mistress. A tedious hour elapsed,
when our son was the joyful messenger of thy safe
landing at Paulus Hook. Stiff with cold how must
his papa have fared? Yet grateful for his safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I blessed my God. I envied the ground which bore
my pilgrim. I pursued each footstep. Love engrossed
his mind; his last adieu to Bartow was the
most persuasive token. 'Wait till I reach the opposite
shore that you may bear the glad tidings to
your trembling mother.' O, Aaron, how I thank
thee! Love in all its delirium hovers about me;
like opium it lulls me to safe repose! Sweet serenity
speaks, 'tis my Aaron presides. Surrounding
objects check my visionary charm. I fly to my
room and give the day to thee."
</p></div>

<p>New York was undergoing a great transition.
She was outgrowing her maidenhood,
and her swift feet took sure foothold in
meadow, swamp, and woodland. To these
changes Burr was unconscious. He had
known her well and loved her, but when his
clear brain grew listless and his eyes lost
their fire she cast him out. Soon came the
day when he was to look at the familiar
sights for the last time. Tears filled his
eyes as he gazed from the deck of the primitive
steamboat which voyaged twice a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
from the Battery to Staten Island. He
knew that it was his last farewell, and the
calloused heart was melted. In that sad
moment his friend must have held his feeble
hand. The world had not deprived him of
everything&mdash;there was something at the last!</p>

<p>When Aaron Burr was brought to the
Richmond Inn, the hostelry was kept by
Daniel Winant, a man of Dutch descent.
He was assisted in his task by two young
daughters, who were the life of the little
hamlet. Old Port Richmond residents used
to tell of their kindness to the famous guest,
nursing him devotedly and doing all in their
power to shield him from the annoyance of
curious strangers who journeyed to the Port
to gaze upon him.</p>

<p>Among the guests stopping at the hotel
during Burr's last days there was a young
man of twenty-four by the name of Olando
Buel, from New Preston in Connecticut.
The quizzical, genial Olando in his little
shop, cutting posies and weeping willows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
on tombstones or making tall mahogany
clocks with wonderful embellishments, still
lives in the minds of many of the islanders.
In God's acres, which lie north and south
and east and west over this isle of the great
State of New York, Olando's white blooms
cover many and many a green mound.
What a great man was Olando, to record
the lives of a small army of humanity!
Sweet were the emblems he placed over their
faded lives. Close to the specimens of his
handiwork are older stones on which are
figured skulls and other cruel reminders of
death; but Olando gave his tired ones the
emblems of nature, the never-ceasing resurrection.
The elements are sweeping away
some of his trees and flowers, it is true, for
this youth from New England came to cut
tombstones as a travelling apprentice to one
Thompson, in the spring before Aaron Burr
thought of Staten Island as his last home.</p>

<p>Olando frequently occupied a seat next to
Burr on the gallery, and in after-years the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
interested visitor could always induce him to
relate his memories of this time. The favorite
among his stories was of Mrs. Webb's
arrival at the inn to obtain a last look at the
face of her old friend the morning after his
death. Olando had prepared the body for
its final resting-place the night before and
was still in charge of the remains. Mrs.
Webb came heavily veiled and accompanied
by her small daughter. In the hall they
waited until the chamber of death was deserted,
and then timidly crossed its threshold.
When the passionate tears of this noble
woman fell on the withered face of the dead,
the heart of her observer was touched, and
he gazed on the scene with wet eyes.</p>

<p>Several times during the months of July
and August Burr took rides back into the
country. The Ogden chaise, drawn by a bay
horse, would stop at the Inn in the afternoon
while the sun was still high. Tommy, the
lad who kept the garden path clean for the
soft crinolines that caressed it in the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
afternoon and early evening, never neglected
an opportunity to leave the slouching
weeds for the excitement of running up
the steep steps and hammering the heavy
knocker, calling out in the shrill trumpet
tones of youth, "Here's the chaise for Colonel
Burr! Here's the chaise." The buxom
calico-clad figure of one of the Misses
Winant would open the door, and through
the hall and up the narrow winding staircase
would rush the boy. Out on the gallery,
in the depths of the old cushioned
draught chair, an expectant figure always
sat waiting for the near approach of those
eager, clattering feet. With the boy's help
he rises tremblingly, and we see him there
in the sunlight,&mdash;a slight, emaciated old man
in a Continental blue coat, a thin, worn face
which has lost all the beauty of his famous
likeness given to the world by Stuart's
brush, but eyes still lustrous and ofttimes
full of fire. Into the shadows, down the
staircase and the porch, the strong young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
arms of the boy almost carry him. After
them comes the faithful Miss Winant with
Burr's great-coat, carefully treading on tiptoe
lest she should attract his attention to
her heavy burden. With the united efforts
of the coachman, the boy, and his landlady,
Burr is seated in the chaise. The coachman
cracks his whip over the plodding mare, and
the old-style vehicle bearing its precious
burden rounds the corner into a world of
green.</p>

<p>A pathetic and almost tragic picture of
Burr has been recorded on one of these
drives. On a gray, melancholy afternoon,
while being driven through a neighboring
village, he passed a group of rustic militia
attempting a drill. His old eyes lighted up
as he gazed upon them, and his mind went
back to the time when he wore regimentals in
the service of his country.</p>

<p>Calling out to the wind, for no one was
by his side, he is said to have exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, one might have fancied these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
yokels as having just ravelled off Washington's
pet brigade! Washington! oh,
Washington!"</p>

<p>Until the carriage had left the village far
behind he continued to hold communion with
himself. The twilight was enveloping him.
He saw the youthful hero, Burr, storming
the heights of Quebec, rescuing the brigade
of General Knox, routing the enemy at
Hackensack; now starving at Valley Forge
and again enduring the hell of Monmouth.
With ghosts from out the past he lived
again.</p>

<p>Through the summer Burr lingered on at
the old hostelry until September 14, 1836,
when his tired eyes closed forever. At noon
Dr. Van Pelt, the minister of the nearby
Dutch Reformed Church whom Burr had
refused so often to see, came on his last
visit of consolation. Through his life he
declared that Burr's death was one of peace,
despite the many stories to the contrary.</p>

<p>History has never clearly revealed those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
who grouped themselves about his bedside,
but this we know: by the door stood the
Misses Winant and a few humble friends
his last days had brought him. Their tears
were among the most heartfelt shed over the
courageous one whose dreams were delusions
and great deeds ashes.</p>

<p class="tch">The Poetic Courtship of Philip Freneau,
the Poet of the Revolution,
and Beautiful Eleanor Forman</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">O</span>VER a hundred years ago, in the most
luxuriant part of Monmouth County,
a garden spot of New Jersey, two large
white houses smiled at each other through
the changing seasons across a long vista of
billowing field. The one nearest the sea was
Mount Pleasant Hall, the home of the Freneaus,
and the other, on the outskirts of
Freehold, was Forman Place, the home of
the Formans. Tall trees lined the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
roads that crept so lovingly about them,
grain and fruit grew in abundance on their
broad acres, and flowers filled the gardens.
Surely it was an ideal setting for a poetic
courtship.</p>

<p>In the history of American belles-lettres
it would be hard to find a more interesting
couple than Philip Freneau, the poet of the
Revolution, and the Jersey beauty he made
his bride. Their life was the sweetest of
pastorals. Like two brilliant butterflies, they
flitted through years softly tinctured with
shadows. When the world ill-used them,
they sought refuge at the Pierian spring.
Calliope was their sure consoler, and it was
only when their gay wings were crushed
and broken at the last that they forgot her.</p>

<p>Both belonged to distinguished families
counted among the gentry class of the time.
The Freneaus were descended from the
Huguenot house of De Fresneau, famous
in the history of La Rochelle. Andr&eacute; Freneau,
the poet's grandfather, upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
arrival in New York identified himself with
the Royal West India Company of France.
His associates in its interest were Auguste
Jay and &Eacute;tienne Delancey, two men of
prominence in the early city. He is several
times mentioned in the Journal of John
Fontaine, who visited New York in 1716.
His son, Pierre Freneau, resided in one of
the finest dwellings on old Frankfort Street,
and there his wife held a miniature court
for the French society that found its way to
the Dutch city flourishing under the English
flag.</p>

<p>The Formans came from as notable stock
as the Freneaus. One of their ancestors was
a Lord Mayor of London, and Lady Mary
Forman is recorded as dazzling New Orleans
with her finery at the beginning of the
eighteenth century. Tradition says that
Mrs. Samuel Forman, a jolly dame and a
leader of the old Monmouth neighborhood,
used to ride to the Tennent Church in a
golden coach. It was at that old church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
close by the battle-field of Monmouth, that
Philip Freneau first saw his Nelly and grew
to love her.</p>

<p>Little Tennent has borne the marks of
time lightly since the youth and the maiden
shyly gazed at each other across the narrow
aisle. Very sweetly her voice would ring out
to the gay-tuned airs, for the music was
lively in Tennent after that good nomadic
dominie, George Whitefield, introduced the
fashion of theatrical music in church. It
was an often-repeated county jest in Monmouth
that no one could fall asleep in the
Tennent Church, the pews were so hard and
straight-backed, and the choir so noisy.</p>

<p>Eleanor Forman was of a type which has
always appealed to the poets. Her features
were regular, her eyes blue and languishing,
and her hair the color of pale sunshine. So
fair and lasting was her complexion that, as
an old lady, a Freehold gallant compared it
to "the lilies and garden pinks." In those
long-dead Sabbaths Freneau and his boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
friends, home on vacations from the College
of New Jersey, no doubt thought her a very
attractive picture as she nestled by her
mother's rich beflowered brocade, a tiny
figure in white muslin and soft ribbons.
James Madison saw her then, and, although
she was too young for his companionship,
he never forgot her charm, and in after-years,
when she had entered the poet's life,
he was one of the most loyal frequenters of
her little salon in Philadelphia during Washington's
second administration.</p>

<p>Although Philip Freneau, as an elderly
gentleman given to reminiscence, used to relate
that Eleanor Forman crept into his
heart in his boyhood before he became a
wandering pedagogue, it was not until long
after his arrival at manhood's estate that she
stormed and took the citadel. There was
another romance in his life before his Nelly.
At the immature age of sixteen he fell in
love with a Jersey maiden residing near his
home, whose name is lost to posterity. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
died early of consumption, and the poet's
verses at the time show his melancholy state
of mind.</p>

<p>In "The Power of Fancy" he wrote of
her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Fancy, stop and rove no more,</div>
<div class="verse">Now, tho' late returning home,</div>
<div class="verse">Lead me to Belinda's tomb;</div>
<div class="verse">Let me glide as well as you</div>
<div class="verse">Through the shroud and coffin, too.</div>
<div class="verse">And behold, a moment, there</div>
<div class="verse">All that once was good and fair.</div>
<div class="verse">Who doth here so soundly sleep?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall we break this prison deep?</div>
<div class="verse">Thunders cannot wake the maid,</div>
<div class="verse">Lightnings cannot pierce the shade,</div>
<div class="verse">And tho' wintry tempests roar,</div>
<div class="verse">Tempests shall disturb no more."</div>
</div>

<p>Another of his poems, entitled "Amanda
in a Consumption," tells the whole pitiful
story of his misplaced passion. We sympathize
with a lover who was no more than a
boy when we read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"When wandering in the evening shade,</div>
<div class="verse1">I shared her pain and calmed her grief,</div>
<div class="verse">A thousand tender things I said,</div>
<div class="verse1">But all I said gave no relief:</div>
<div class="verse">When from her hair I dried the dew</div>
<div class="verse">She sighed and said&mdash;'I'm not for you.'"</div>
</div>

<p>There is an old saying that "love weeping
burns away," and soon the boy ceased to
write lamentations over his lost Belinda.
Events were crowding thick and fast into his
life at this time; years of travel and excitement
had helped him to forget her; and
when he returned to "the old house at Monmouth"
on a summer day in 1780, weary of
war and ill from long incarceration in a
British prison-ship, he was in a state of mind
to fall in love with the little Nelly of old
Tennent days.</p>

<p>Like Philip Freneau, who had written
from his earliest childhood, Eleanor Forman
began the indulgence of her muse in
her teens. One of her books still in existence
shows her first thoughts put into verse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
"Lines to a Lady's Singing-Bird" are
scribbled over a copper print of a placid
shepherdess, and words ready for rhyming
embellish some of the margins. The pompous
Mrs. Forman was very proud of her
daughter's accomplishment, and it is said
that, on Eleanor's composing some tributary
verses to her mother's pet gray turkey, she
presented her with a pair of paste shoe-buckles
whose glitter affected the heart of
every Monmouth maid and swain.</p>

<p>Beside Freneau's own stream running
through the valley of young pine-trees
near the Hall the romantic Eleanor loved
to come to dream. There one day she found
another dreamer, and the chance meeting
was the beginning of one of the most poetic
love-affairs.</p>

<p>This pleasant stream was almost a human
thing to the poet. In the days before he
found his Eleanor seated on its bank he addressed
to it his last musings on the vanished
Belinda:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Where the pheasant roosts at night,</div>
<div class="verse">Lonely, drowsy, out of sight,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the evening breezes sigh,</div>
<div class="verse">Solitary, there stray I.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Close along the shaded stream,</div>
<div class="verse">Source of many a youthful dream,</div>
<div class="verse">Where branchy cedars dim the day,</div>
<div class="verse">There I muse and there I stray."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Later, with "the fairest of women" by his
side, when Belinda had grown to be only a
memory, he composed his exquisite poem,
"Retirement:"</p>

<div class="poem">

</div> <!-- poem -->

<p>Reading its faded original, we hear the
strong, mellifluous voice of the poet that the
ladies of Charleston used to grow enthusiastic
over when he visited his brother Peter
in that city, and our minds grow retrospective,
leading us back through the years to the
couple by the little silver thread of water
which long ago gave up its life to some
mysterious unknown ocean. What a joyous
thing it is when she is near him to listen to
his words and share in his flights of fancy!
The wind whispers through the pine-trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and their soft sighing mingles with the
gurgling cadences of the wavelets and
breaks up the sunlit silence. The wind is
a dream wind, and brings to them both
sweet visions of the future. The house,
surrounded by walls "with ivy overgrown"
and "remote from domes of care," where he
longs to take her, is almost a reality. Fate
is a hag old and blind, and Life is a song
from a charmed lute.</p>

<p>Soon after his meeting with Nelly Forman,
Freneau wrote his tragedy of "Major
Andr&eacute;," which was never presented before
the footlights. It is not known whether he
ever gave it to a printer, and only fragments
of his manuscript are in existence to-day.
A portion of it shows us the unfortunate
Andr&eacute; pleading for his life before a tribunal,
and as we finger the time-stained
paper, desecrated by the household accounts
of later years, a tearful Eleanor rises up
before us, listening to the impassioned reading
of her poetic lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>For his "Major Andr&eacute;" Freneau wrote a
prologue, which he afterwards changed and
permitted to be spoken at the opening of the
Philadelphia Theatre. This he dedicated
"to his Excellency General Washington."</p>

<p class="center">"PROLOGUE</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Peace, heaven-born peace, o'er spacious regions spread,</div>
<div class="verse">While discord, sinking, veils her ghastly head."</div>
</div>

<p>In the soft autumn twilights of the days
that followed, when the yellow Morris turnpike
grew vague and shadowy and the stars
dotted the sky like little candles lighting up
a hundred pieces of rose- and dusk-tinted
velvet, Freneau would mount his faithful
Cato and ride through the avenue of locust-trees
into the lane leading to Forman Place.
Dear to their hearts were these trysts of the
lovers. There were walks in the Forman
garden, made a place of enchantment by the
breath of Indian summer. Later came songs
in Madam Forman's chintz parlor. All
through their lives Nelly sang to her Philip
the love-ditties of sighing Darbys and unhappy
Joans; and even after his death,
when very aged, it is said that she sometimes
crooned to his spirit in a queer
cracked voice the songs he once loved to
hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Forman Place, still standing close to the
village of Freehold, what a place of memories
it is! The tired, weather-beaten old
building which the sunshine seems to desecrate
was once one of the happiest of homes.
Now, like some sleepy antique dame belated
after a revelry, it waits despairingly by the
turn of the road for Father Time and his
band of winds to sweep it away. Broad-shouldered
and broad-hearted Samuel Forman,
with a rubicund visage made familiar
by Hogarth, was an ideal host. Oh, the
Merry-Andrews and the witlings Euphrosyne
brought there! "Better one's house
be too little one day than too big all the year
after" was his motto, and bantering bucks
were broadcast round his board.</p>

<p>And Madam Forman, who came of a
pious family, but was married at fifteen,
early caught the infection from her spouse.
None could resist the laugh of the portly
dame so redolent of good-humor. Tongues
that wagged said her handmaidens were willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to work their fingers off in her service
if she would let them. Her daughters she
cajoled into the idea that they were wits as
well as beauties, and men, from callow youth
down to the very grandfathers of the parish,
worshipped the ground she tripped upon.
Whether gracing her chintz parlor, garbed
in a lustrous grenadine, her powdered hair
covered with a hundred ringlets that dangled
and danced as she talked, or in humble linsey-woolsey
overseeing the daily baking, the
chance guest was always sure of a welcome
from the mistress of Forman Place.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho! there's Jeremy, Juniper, or
Tobias. What a lark!" the great voice of
her lord and master would come floating
over the staircase or from the depths of the
cushioned grandfather's chair in the library.
"Yes, he's here, Samuel, and promised to
sup," the echo would answer. It was to this
happy haven the horseman rode very often
after the meeting by the stream.</p>

<div class="caption">NOW, LIKE SOME SLEEPY ANTIQUE DAME BELATED AFTER A REVELRY,
IT WAITS DESPAIRINGLY BY THE TURN OF THE ROAD</div>
</div>

<p>The days drifted into months and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
months into years, and the drama of the
Revolution was nearing its triumphant end
for the patriot. Monmouth was awakening
as from a lethargy. After the ravages it
had endured through the early periods of
the war, life had become stagnant. At
Mount Pleasant Hall Freneau had written
many a stirring verse which had travelled
from Concord to Yorktown, encouraging
the ofttimes despairing soldiers. Not a
memorable incident escaped his watchful
eye. Behind the ardent and passionate desire
for liberty was the inspiration of love
to guide his pen. The love of country and
the love of woman were intertwined, and it
was his thrilling visions of the first that
brought sweet dreams of the other real one
to camp-fire and battle-field. Liberty was a
strange and beautiful goddess that those
tattered, wearied men knew not, and it was
always the memory of the sweetheart's face
that spurred them over rock-bound roads
filled with multitudinous obstacles in quest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the shadowy creature. When they fell
by the wayside or in the trenches, the look
of peace on their white faces was not her
doing, but the tender vows and the last kisses
of the girls they had left behind them.</p>

<p>Soon came peace, and on its trail the last
meeting of the lovers in the Forman garden.
The gates of winter were open and all the
gorgeous flower-children slumbering in the
earth. By the golden sundial a solitary
purple pansy bloomed, hoping that the
false shimmer was the sun, and in Madam
Forman's rose-bed yellow blushmaids were
glowing at the bleak landscape like incense
lamps on some dim altar. There had been
a family conference in Forman Place the
night before. Eleanor's brother David, the
stern "Black David" of Germantown fame,
who had recently laid down his gun and sabre
by his father's hearth, was incensed at his
sister's betrothal to the poet. Mrs. Freneau's
fortune was almost depleted by the
inroads of the war. "That scribbling fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
is no match for Eleanor," the warrior said.
The household, seated about the heavy oaken
table in the hall where the letters and the last
<i>Gazette</i> always lay, listened to his words of
wisdom. Every one was always silent when
David spoke, for his sentences were like
nails,&mdash;something to be driven into the
hearts of his hearers. No one could dispute
him. "The Freneaus no longer kept
up the state they flourished during their first
years in Monmouth; a poet's pen could not
support a wife! The engagement was worse
than foolhardy. Many a man of wealth as
well as parts would be seeking Eleanor."</p>

<p>Samuel, in the great Hepplewaite chair,
was silent. The mirth lines about his mouth
drooped and lengthened. He liked Freneau,
whose ready tongue always held a
jest. His blue-eyed Nelly loved him, he
knew. Furtively he turned and stole a
glance at his wife for help to stem the
wrath of the stern dictator, but the good
dame held a handkerchief to her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Trouble weighed heavily on her heart.
Eleanor stood by the door gazing out of
the blurred panes at the road that led to
the Freneaus. Her face was pale, but suffused
with the light of love. Before her
was the highway of Fate, and her heart told
her that it would not admit of another.</p>

<p>"David," she said, looking at him, "you
may be a great man in war counsel, but when
a woman is the question you know naught.
With the man I love I could wander penniless
but unwearied all through life."</p>

<p>There was silence; then Madam Forman
tried to speak, but her voice was choked with
sobs.</p>

<p>And so it was that the lovers met in the
dying garden and said good-by. She told
him of her brother's words, and into his life
there came a new desire. His country
needed his pen no longer. The fortune his
father's will gave to his mother had been
placed on the altar of patriotism, and much
of it went into the ship "Aurora," captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
by the British. He would leave his home
to seek another fortune, and, when it was
won, return and claim her.</p>

<p>The air was sultry and the moon hung like
a dying taper over their heads. The fields
that crept up to the Homdel hills he loved so
well were gray. A north wind sighed among
the wraiths of summer in the garden, a harbinger
that the dawn would be fresh and
clear.</p>

<p>"I shall never marry any one else," she
told him. "My window faces the bend of
the road, and there I shall place a candle
every night to light your steps when they
bring you back to me. Often I shall go to
the little stream and wonder where you are
wandering. Never fear. I shall wait for
you forever and forever, until my cheeks
fade and my eyes grow dim."</p>

<p>Like one of the flowers in the garden trying
to hide its head from the death-stings
of the wind, she nestled in his arms. The
moon grew faint behind the clouds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the soughing low and melodious, for a
woman's heart was being spilled over the
highway.</p>

<p>The next morning a small procession left
Mount Pleasant Hall and crept over the
Morris turnpike road to the Point. There
were the poet and his mother in the antiquated
chaise, Josiah, an old negro household
slave, mounted on Cato, and several of
the field servants, carrying a large wooden
chest, following on foot. The air was fresh
and strong, and, although the day was
young, the blue of the sky deep and pure.
John Burrowes's sailing-vessel was to leave
Kearny Port, bound for Philadelphia, before
the noon hour.</p>

<p>The sunshine played over the yellow, clay-stained
road, and off in the distance the
sea was a sheet of burnished gold. Some
place where its arms spread was the promised
land the poet hoped to find. There his
work would bring him a reward that would
help him to win his love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Port the vessel was anchored in the
calm inlet with her bowsprit pointed to the
dancing waves beyond. Old Mrs. Burrowes,
the corn merchant's wife, with some
of her grandchildren, was on the wharf to
see him off. When she saw the Freneau
chaise, she ran forward to meet its occupants.
"Yes, I am very sure my husband can take
Mr. Freneau to Philadelphia," she said, in
answer to their inquiries. Mrs. Freneau
alighted and sat with her on one of the grain
sacks while the poet went to seek Mr. Burrowes.
All about them was bustle and confusion
preparatory to a long cruise. Soon
came the hour of leaving and the last farewells.
Tears filled the mother's eyes as she
kissed her son. Once before she had watched
him depart to wrestle with the world beyond
her quiet land. No cruel war was to claim
him now, and yet she could not hide her
anguish at parting. His own heart was full
of courage and the breath of the sea was like
wine to him. The fortune his mother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
given to her country he would build again!
As he embraced his mother, before his eyes
was the face of the woman he thought the
most beautiful in the world. She was worth
the price of conquest.</p>

<p>After Philip left, Eleanor took to watching
the highway. It had brought him to her,
and in the dawn, the noonday, and the dusk
she looked out upon it from the windows of
her room, longing for his return. Every
night she placed the candle in the farthest
sill, as she promised him at parting. He
was constantly in her thoughts. As time
went on other suitors came to Forman Place
to pay to her their addresses. Hezekiah
Stout, the great mill-owner of Englishtown,
was one of them. That Revolutionary
Cr&oelig;sus received more encouragement
from David than from the lady of his
choice. Hezekiah proved a patient lover,
for when she refused to see him, he would
sit silently blinking on the Forman settle
for hours at a time, until Madam Forman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the best-natured woman in the world, vowed
to herself that, with all his money, he was
too stupid a man to wed her daughter.</p>

<p>And the little silver stream that whispered
its secrets to the slim pine-trees, how it
missed the pair! Many a time it wearily
watched the winter wane and earth cast off
her white mantle. The wild anemones came,
the primroses and the crocuses and all that
lovely company of fragile blooms which
mark the footsteps of hope. "Oh, if he
would but come now while I mirror so much
beauty," the stream crooned to herself.
Sometimes she would see among the flowers
the reflection of the fair face he loved.
Then the little stream was happy. "She
at least remembers, and perhaps he will
come soon," she sang in joy to the pine-trees.
Then the grasses grew high, and the
golden sunshine lured the dragon-flies to flit
among the fragrant worlds along her course.
Still he came not. She began to grow impatient.
Perhaps her heart would be dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
up before his children strolled by her side
and waded in her clear water. The leaves
began to fall, and the worlds along her
course knew that the night was coming on.
"He has forgotten," the stream moaned;
"forgotten." And, hundreds of miles away,
he heard her voice, and in the hold of an ice-bound
ship wrote to his stream and his love,
whom he called Cynthia, these tender verses:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Through Jersey groves a wandering stream</div>
<div class="verse1">That still its wonted music keeps</div>
<div class="verse">Inspires no more my evening dream,</div>

</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Now, fettered fast in icy fields,</div>

</div> <!-- poem -->

<p>Mammon proved a cruel and elusive mistress
to Freneau, and she led him many a
fruitless errand in pursuit of her. For several
years he commanded the brig "Washington,"
owned by his brother Peter. In this
ship he made many journeys to the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Indies, and by clever trading at last succeeded
in amassing a small competence.
With this he returned to Mount Pleasant
Hall after an absence of nearly six years.</p>

<p>In the spring of that year the lovers were
united. The wedding held in Forman Place
was a very simple affair, attended by only
a few of the Monmouth neighborhood.
After his marriage the poet took his bride
home to Mount Pleasant Hall, and later to
Philadelphia, where Mrs. Freneau's little
salon played a part in the history of the
capital. A diary of Freneau's life in that
city is said to be in existence, and it is to be
hoped that it will some day come to light.</p>

<p>The love-letters of the charming Freneaus,
written for the most part in verse,
were destroyed many years ago. Several of
the poems compiled in the editions of Freneau's
works are thought to have been written
by his wife. Like Mrs. Wordsworth,
who is credited with helping her husband
with his masterpiece, "The Daffodils," Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>

<div class="verse">The frail duration of a flower."</div>
</div>
</div> <!-- poem -->

<p>One cannot read these verses without entering
into a closer intimacy with "The
Poet of the Revolution" and the beautiful
Eleanor Forman. Their courtship was
idyllic, and during the long stretch of years
they walked together hand in hand the flame
of love never diminished, but grew brighter.
From the day of their marriage, when Freneau
is recorded as having compared his
blushing bride to Fielding's "Amelia," the
ideal characterization of womanhood, until
one wintry dawn forty-five years later,
when a trembling, aged Eleanor bent over
the lifeless body of her lover lulled to sleep
in a snow-drift, no discordant note entered
the sweet harmony of their lives. When
shadows dimmed their pathway, they clung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
closer to each other. Even death could
not separate them. When Freneau was
under the sod and the world disputing over
the few poor bay leaves it had allowed him,
her mind was constantly with the lover of her
youth. In her maidenhood she had watched
weary years for him to come back to her, and
at the last, when his voice was hushed in "the
land of no returning," she longed to go to
him.</p>

<p class="tch">The Chevalier de Silly and his Newport
Sally</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the old portion of Newport, where the
houses are compact and the streets hilly
and narrow, is the Vernon mansion, erected
many years before the Revolution, when the
city ranked second only to Boston in commercial
supremacy. William Vernon, its
first owner, was one of the wealthy old-time
traders whose fleet of merchantmen made
the long wharf famous. There, in the days
before British guns were trained on the city
and stanch, opulent warehouses flanked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
quays, his jolly tars would unload the
cargoes of West Indian sugar and bring
out of some brave ship's hold the half a
hundred blacks. Most of those ship-loads
of sugar would be made into rum and sent
back to Africa or the Indies for more blacks;
but the savages never saw their native homes
again, and became the faithful Cudjos and
Pompeys of many a colonial household.</p>

</div>

<p>Quaint Mary Lane, or Street, as it is now
called, running past the Vernon residence, is
truly a thoroughfare of memories. For a
period of three years it was trodden by the
feet of thousands of British soldiers, and
later the gallant Frenchmen of Rochambeau's
fleet of seven ships of the line and
five frigates walked there disconsolately in
groups of three or four, hoping soon to sail
away from the poverty-stricken place Newport
was at that period of its existence. No
longer were there gentlemen of fortune like
Colonel Godfrey Malbone, who so often
clinked silver goblets with his guests over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
groaning tables, to give entertainments.
The town was almost destitute of wealth,
and but a small number of the better class
of its population came back to their former
dwellings during the French fleet's stay
there.</p>

<p>Life in Newport during 1780 and 1781
was for the most part a dreary thing to these
Frenchmen, but a host of dashing chevaliers
fresh from the Court of "the Austrian," as
spiteful Madame Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de had nicknamed
her fair niece, were sure to find some amusement
even in the dullest city. It is true there
was no "prince of youth," as the court ringleader,
the Comte d'Artois, was dubbed by
his intimates, to lead them through days of
delight as at Versailles and Fontainebleau,
but Newport gallants soon introduced them
to town beauties, and cards were laid for the
ever new and exciting game of love. In
lieu of the cabriolet races in the Bois de
Boulogne they could skate in the little creeks
about the Point, and when dreams of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Palais Royal made them long for "Armid"
and "Alcestio," there was always a dame to
finger a spinet. Old citizens of the past
generation used to tell of window-panes in
the Vernon mansion covered with the names
of Newport's femininity. With the same
spirit which later led their compatriots to
jest and dance amid the grim shadows of
the Conceirgerie, they made the best of a
changed life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cowley's assembly-room, famous in
Newport annals, was made over into a salon
for play, and there the youth of the army
would often stray when the periods of duty
were over. We can see the haughty Rochambeau
with his muff bending over the tric-trac
table, while about him flutter the very
flower of France,&mdash;men bearing such names
as Marquis de Chastelleux, Marquis de
Laval, Baron de Closen, Vicomte de
Noailles, Marquis de Custine, Comte de
Fersen, and Duc de Lauzun. They who had
lost and won their louis to the laughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the fairest women of a famous court had
for sole spectators little village gamins peering
in at the windows. Before the glitter of
gold these graceful gamesters forgot time
and place. They were back again at tables
in the gardens of Paris,&mdash;recreation spots as
lovely as Little Trianon, where Oberkirche
wrote, "The glades were perfumed with
lilacs and peopled with nightingales&mdash;The
air full of fragrant mist brightened by
butterflies." Off came their tinselled coats,
and in their stead some of them donned
frieze great-coats, while the more intrepid
rolled thin soft linen shirt-sleeves up to the
elbow for luck. To guard their eyes from
the light and keep their powdered wigs in
place, they tied on straw-crowned hats festooned
with some forgotten charmer's colors.
The Maybud plucked many moons before,
which nestled so often 'neath a tassel, was
faded. Cliff flowers were in full bloom then.</p>

<p>The belles of Newport! What pages
could be devoted to them! A more en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>chanting
galaxy of femininity never enriched
a New England town. The Duc de
Lauzun, an ardent spirit in our struggle for
liberty who left his countrymen enthusiastic
over republican ideas, the ladies even going
so far as to have their hair dressed <i>aux insurgents</i>,
wrote home from Newport of their
charms. The Misses Hunter, daughters of
Dr. William Hunter, he particularly admired.
"I was not in love with them," he
coyly confided, "but had they been my sisters
I could not have loved them more."</p>

<p>Three famous beauties were Miss Champlin,
who danced with stately Washington;
Miss Redwood, to whose charms the sailors
in the street would doff their caps, holding
them low until she passed; and Sally
Church, the sprightly maiden who, tradition
says, tripped into the hearts of a
small army of Frenchmen when she returned
from Providence to her native city
about the time of the French fleet's arrival.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<a id="WANTON"><img src="images/illus167.jpg" width="443" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">MRS. WANTON, A BELLE OF NEWPORT</div>
</div>



<p>Sally Church! how prim the pseudonym,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and yet very vivacious was its owner. A
charming vision in her red wool gown and
huge fur tippet, we see her mincing merrily
through that Mary Street on a blustering
March morning. The wind blows her
wide London hat and gives it a saucy tilt,
and the eyes of a long line of soldiers follow
the wave of her skirt as it plays about her
trim ankles. "Here comes Sally in her
chair," or "Here comes Sally on foot," were
among the most interesting pieces of news
her admirers had to impart. They ogled
and sang to her, wrote poems on her beauty;
and yet at most of them she only laughed,
and so they ended by worshipping her.</p>

<p>As the months flew by there lay in one of
the rooms of the Vernon mansion, which
Rochambeau had made his head-quarters, a
young lieutenant by the name of Chevalier
de Silly, suffering from a disease protracted
by the severe cold. Having heard his brother
officers dilate on the charms of the lovely
Sally, he desired that his bed be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
close to the window, in hope that he might
obtain a glimpse of her. Many a weary hour
he spent gazing out into the gray line of the
street unrewarded, and then one happy day
he espied her. The fates favored him, and
Sally, chancing to look up at his window,
smiled and thereby added another soldier to
her own little army. Soon the Chevalier
grew better and was able to assume the
duties of his post. His friendship with
Sally had progressed by this time and she
was becoming the torment of his life,&mdash;an
agony far worse than bodily illness. As
he stood on duty&mdash;a grim sentinel&mdash;before
the Vernon mansion, the maiden would happen
to stroll by.</p>

<p>"Come, Silly," she would call, "take me
for a walk to the old mill."</p>

<p>"I cannot, mademoiselle," was his usual
sad answer; "the king's service goes before
everything."</p>

<p>"You do not love me or you would take
me," she always mocked, and with a proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
toss of her head she would hasten past him,
heedless of his torrent of reproaches.</p>

<p>And so "Silly and his Sally," as the youth
and the maiden came to be dubbed by the
garrison, spent their days. Tradition says
that she was fonder of him than of any other
of her French swains, but, womanlike, enjoyed
the power of her fascinations. But
she was not to keep him in her train forever.
The springlike day dawned when General
Washington, "the Atlas of America," Silly
called him, was to arrive. At Barney's Ferry
he landed in a gayly decorated barge, and
all Newport was out to greet him. The
troops formed a solid line three deep on
either side from the long wharf to the very
door of the Vernon mansion, where he was
to be entertained by Rochambeau. The following
night all Newport was illuminated,
and old records say that the Town Council
ordered candles to be purchased and given
to all who were too poor to use them, so that
every house should show a light. About the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
streets the hero rode, followed by the French
officers, their aides, and hundreds of patriotic
citizens bearing candle torches to make the
occasion joyful. The night was clear, the
sea calm, and the wind still. Those who
participated in the affair never forgot the
beauty of the scene. Sally was in the crowd,
but there was no Silly by her side, for the
disconsolate Chevalier wrote to a friend
that, "after General Washington, she who
attracted my attention was the amiable Sally
Church accompanied, alas! by a faithful
townsman who was free of a touch of the
gout."</p>

<p>A few days later, when the gout departed,
the Chevalier had his revenge on her other
suitors at a ball given by the city of Newport
to General Washington and Admiral
Rochambeau, in Mrs. Cowley's assembly-room.
There, to the rippling airs of Gluck,
so beloved by musical little Marie Antoinette,
he showed the company many of the
famous Guimard steps, as he essayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
gavottes of his king. Sally would look
at him often, admiration springing forth
from her sparkling eyes, as he gracefully
swayed to music, one moment gay and the
next sinking into a gentle cadence. This is
one of the last records we have of Sally and
her Silly dancing out the swift-footed hours
in the taper-lighted ballroom.</p>

<p>Numerous accounts of the ball have come
down to us. The decorations were intrusted
to Dezoteux, one of the aides of the Baron
de Viom&eacute;nil, and the guests are said to have
been loud in the appreciation of his efforts.
Washington opened the festivities by leading
out Miss Champlin in a minuet. When
midnight was near at hand and frolic and
mirth at their highest pitch, the gallant
Rochambeau and several of his officers led
an assault on the startled musicians, and,
seizing their instruments, played the tune,
"A Successful Campaign,"&mdash;a graceful
token of respect to the Commander-in-Chief
of the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>We picture them together when he homeward
walks beside her chair, the constant
lover, to her very gate. With the memory
of the music in her ears, the stars overspreading
the sky a dazzling canopy, and a cavalier
by her side, could she ask for more? And
yet she did, and, alack-a-day, as she herself
would have said, the stream of her life was
not always so fresh and frolicking. Could
the chairmen tell us more? No doubt; but
leave the door tight shut and spare a lady's
blushes.</p>

<p>The day came when the Chevalier de Silly
sailed away to Yorktown, and the maiden
was left to work her witcheries on her townsmen.
Newport was a changed place after
the French departed. Many a true heart
was exchanged that morning for a golden
button or some other token. The mothers
only were happy, and back to households
came a troop of long-exiled femininity, free
from the fret of love. Twelve years later,
it is said, one summer dawn in Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
there rolled through the streets a tumbril
on its way to a guillotine erected near
the gardens of the Luxembourg. One of its
occupants was De Silly. In the hush which
always fell on the mob when a victim reached
the last step of the stairway of death we
wonder whether the fair face of Sally
Church came before the eyes of her poor
Chevalier. The answer is lost in the length
of long-dead years. Over the cries of that
surging mass of humanity when the blade
snapped the thread of his life we see them
once again living out their Newport romance.</p>

<p class="tch">Susanna Rowson, of "Charlotte Temple"
Fame, and her British Grenadier</p>

<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">O</span>VERLOOKING Nantasket's white
beach, and guarded, as it were, by
the little hills of Hull, is a dwelling, now
entirely changed, where Susanna Haswell
spent her girlhood. A quarter of a century
ago it was still as the Haswells left it when
they were forced to remove to the neighboring
town of Hingham, practically prisoners
of war. Then it was described as a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
one-story wooden building with a huge chimney
in the centre, one of a type to be found
in hundreds of old New England villages.
In the days when the English maiden conned
her lessons as her father painted quaint
stilted landscapes on the doors and mantel-pieces
of his abode the house was approached
through a line of fruit-trees, and close to the
gray walls that the sea-mist loved to kiss
grew the multitude of flowers that flourished
in the sweet plots of the descendants of the
Puritans.</p>

<p>Somehow it is with the garden of her early
home that we associate the young Susanna.
Tradition says that it was her especial care,
and she helped the seeds her stepmother
brought from Boston to perfect bloom and
watched each season for her fairy children.
There we know, in the autumn of
1768, when her last garden inmates were
dying, she saw the British fleet of six men-of-war
enter Nantasket Roads, little dreaming
that they were to affect her life. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in the day she helped her father receive some
of the officers. It is easy to picture her, a
simply garbed child, listening to the talk of
the circle about the fireplace. How her eyes
must have glistened at the tales of the
theatres,&mdash;the sprightly new comedy "The
Perplexities," which was put on at Covent
Garden; "The English Merchant," with
its witty prologue by Garrick. Then there
was chatter of the new tea-gardens that
were springing up everywhere on the skirts
of London Town. Wonderful they seemed
with their grottos of mystery and Chinese
lanterns that rivalled the stars. The talk of
war she would not listen to, and we see her
leave the company to creep to the door and
gaze out on the silent night. Very lonely
her home looked in the darkness, and off in
the distance she could hear the dull boom of
the surf telling her that London Town was
far away.</p>

<p>A strange child was this Susanna Haswell.
When the "quality maids" of her day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
spent a large part of their time perusing the
"Boston News Letter" for the latest falafals
and fashions,&mdash;thinking only of fine
brocades, the newest talematongues to make
high their head-dresses, and the Sweet Royal
Honey Water for their fair faces,&mdash;Susanna's
mind was always with her few treasured
books or dwelling on the pleasure she
gave her father in their journeyings near
their home. They would wander off over the
nearby hills in search of the first wild fruits.
Sometimes he would bring his box of colors
and they would linger until nightfall in some
spot that had caught his fancy.</p>

<p>At an early age she began to write verses,
and all through her life kept up this pastime.
Her whisperings to birds, flowers,
and sea-shells helped to fill up her days.
She was happy, we know, for "The Roses
of Life," written at a later period, show
a brave and intrepid spirit that feared neither
isolation nor the daily trials allotted to
mortals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Why should we complain of this life's dreary road,</div>
<div class="verse1">Or the thorns or the thistles that in our path lay?</div>
<div class="verse">Has not heaven a portion of reason bestow'd,</div>
<div class="verse1">To pass them o'er lightly or brush them away?</div>
<div class="verse">I'll gather life's roses wherever I find them,</div>
<div class="verse1">And smile at their folly who dread to come near;</div>
<div class="verse">Who cast all its joys and its pleasures behind them,</div>
<div class="verse1">Nor pluck the sweet buds, lest the thorns should appear."</div>
</div>

<p>The years flew by until after the battle of
Bunker Hill, when most of the inhabitants
of Nantasket left their farms and fled to
Boston. It is recorded that the grain was
left standing in the fields and that the Haswell
family were eventually left the sole
occupants of the place. Ex-Lieutenant Haswell
was loyal to his king, and his house was
a constant resort for the British naval and
military commanders. Small skirmishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sometimes took place near the village, and
one day, during an action in the vicinity, a
wounded redcoat, a member of Major Tupper's
brigade, was brought to the door on a
stretcher by some of his comrades, with the
request that he be given shelter. Into the
southeast room the family had him carried
and laid on the great four-poster. There
Susanna tended him through the morning
hours, bandaging his wounds with soft
homespun and ministering to his wants. It
was a never-to-be-forgotten day, often referred
to in after-years, and it made a deep
impression on the heart of the sensitive girl.
Bending over him, she received his last confidences.
He was Daniel Carnagon, twenty-six
years old, the only son of a clergyman
in the north of England. When his breath
grew feebler her stepmother brought out
the family Bible and read in a low voice
words of comfort. Death came to him as
he dreamed of his native heath and a happy
boyhood. When the dusk began to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Susanna helped her father dig a grave in
the garden. There they laid him to rest with
the last sunbeams staining his poor clay like
a heavenly benediction. Some rose-bushes
and an apple-tree covered his resting-place.
The latter is still standing alone, a faithful
watcher over dust neglected and forgotten.
Little has been written of Susanna's grenadier,
but we know that she who made the
whole of her generation weep with "a tale
of truth" wept over him in the twilight of a
long-dead day.</p>

<p>When the Revolution was nearing its close
the Haswell family removed from Massachusetts
to Halifax, a favorite gathering-place
for loyalists. Susanna was then nearing
womanhood, and, owing to the low state
of her father's pecuniary resources, she was
forced to separate from dearly loved
brothers and sail for England. There
she obtained a situation as governess in a
noble family, which she retained until her
health failed. In 1786 she married Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
William Rowson in London. This gentleman
was then engaged in the hardware business
and also acted as trumpeter in the Royal
Horse-Guards. He was the son of an armorer
to George III., and was noted for
his personal beauty and accomplishments.
It has been recorded that no one who heard
could ever forget "the sublime and spirit-stirring
tones" of his trumpet when he
played for the Boston Handel and Haydn
Society. When he trumpeted "The trumpet
shall sound and the dead shall be raised" he
thrilled his hearers into imagining the last
hour was close at hand.</p>

<p>Shortly after entering the bonds of wedlock
Mrs. Rowson published her first work,
"Victoria," under the patronage of the
Duchess of Devonshire, the famous Carlton
House beauty known to history as the friend
of Charles Fox. Among the subscribers are
such names as Sarah Siddons, General John
Burgoyne, Sir Charles Middleton, and our
own Samuel Adams. The duchess seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
have conceived a warm attachment for her,
and arranged that she should be presented to
no less a personage than "Prince Florizel."
Soon she found a place in the brilliant
galaxy of ladies headed by "The Blue-Stocking
Club," and in 1790, when "Charlotte
Temple" was published, she became one
of the leading literary lights of the day.</p>

<p>"Charlotte Temple" was the heart-toucher
of her generation, and countless
thousands sorrowed over her fate. Her
story, as Mrs. Rowson gave it to the world,
was the greatest success of the day, and it
is said that more editions were printed of it
than of any other novel written in the eighteenth
century. About the life of the real
heroine the years have woven a web some
parts of which can never be unravelled.
Tradition says that she was Charlotte Stanley,
a young lady of great personal beauty
and the daughter of a clergyman related to
the Earl of Derby. Mrs. Rowson wrote of
her that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Her form was faultless, and her mind,</div>
<div class="verse1">Untainted yet by art,</div>
<div class="verse">Was noble, just, humane, and kind,</div>
<div class="verse1">And Virtue warm'd her heart.</div>
<div class="verse1">But, ah! the cruel spoiler came."</div>
</div>

<p>Montreville, her lover, was in reality Colonel
John Montr&eacute;sor, an engineer in the
service of the British army. His name is
given as one of the managers of the famous
Meschianza. It is said that he was a connection
of the Haswell family, and it is a significant
fact that the author's youngest
brother, who distinguished himself in the
war with Tripoli, bore his name.</p>

<p>The story on which Mrs. Rowson founded
her romance was that Colonel Montr&eacute;sor
persuaded Miss Stanley to leave her boarding-school
and elope with him to America at
the opening of the Revolutionary War. She
sailed in his companionship some time in the
year 1774. On the same vessel was his
brother, a fellow-engineer. Arriving at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
New York City, Montr&eacute;sor secured a small
cottage for her at Morrisania, a few miles
distant from the city proper and near to
the Boston post-road. The house she occupied&mdash;a
primitive affair&mdash;is remembered as
standing until 1850.</p>

<p>In the book we read,&mdash;</p>


<div class="bq">
<p>"Montreville gave her one female attendant and
supplied her with what money she wanted; but
business and pleasure so entirely occupied his time
that he had but little to devote to the woman whom
he had brought from all her connections and robbed
of innocence. Sometimes, indeed, he would steal
out at the close of evening and pass a few hours
with her; and then so much was she attached to
him that all her sorrows were forgotten while
blessed with his society; she would enjoy a walk
by moonlight, or sit by him in a little arbor at the
bottom of the garden, and play on the harp, accompanying
it with her plaintive, harmonious
voice. But often, very often, did he promise to
renew his visits, and, forgetful of his promise, leave
her to mourn her disappointment. What painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
hours of expectation would she pass! She would sit
at a window which looked toward a field he used to
cross, counting the minutes and straining her eyes
to catch the first glimpse of his person, till, blinded
with tears of disappointment, she would lean her
head on her hands and give free vent to her sorrow;
then, catching at some new hope, she would
again renew her watchful position till the shades
of evening enveloped every object in a dusky
cloud."</p></div>

<a id="GARDEN"><img src="images/illus191.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">CHARLOTTE TEMPLE IN HER GARDEN<br />
<span style="font-variant: normal;">From an old print</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In one of the old editions of the work
there is a quaint picture of the neglected
girl seated in a mournful attitude in a formal
garden evidently much more pretentious
than the primitive spot that the real heroine
knew. The house in New York City generally
accepted as the place where she died
formerly stood at the corner of Pell and
Doyer Streets and was known as the "Old
Tree House." Her grave is in Trinity
Church-yard; but even that is unauthenticated,
some people having gone so far as to
state that the head-stone that bears her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
is a fiction. It is still the resort of the sentimental,
and it is to be hoped that time cannot
prove that Montr&eacute;sor never sorrowed
there over the girl Mrs. Rowson made famous
as she herself did many years before
on the grave of her British Grenadier.</p>

<p class="tch">The Ghosts of an Old Staten Island
Manor</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the green old village of Tottenville, on
Staten Island, there is still standing the
antiquated Bentley manor-house, erected
during the reign of Queen Anne. It is built
of stone, and reposes on a high flowery slope
overlooking the waters of Staten Island and
the Raritan River. The walls are several
feet thick and the gable roof is almost grotesquely
high and steep, giving the building
a very picturesque appearance. From its
quaint little upper-story casements one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
gaze over the Sound to St. Michael's Church
at Perth Amboy with its quiet graveyard,
where some of the Billops are sleeping.
There they rest in peace, we hope; but, according
to "Perth Towne" tradition, the
fairest in life of that silent company is an
unruly shade, and once a year during the
first quarter of the spring-time moon comes
back to her neglected garden to keep a tryst
and a vow.</p>

<p>Christopher Billop, the first owner of the
house, played a very interesting minor part
in American history. When the Duke of
York conveyed New Jersey to Lord Berkeley
Carteret, a question arose as to whether
Staten Island was included in the grant. To
settle a discussion which threatened to assume
grave proportions, it was decided that
all islands in the harbor should belong to
New York if they could be circumnavigated
in twenty-four hours. Christopher Billop,
who owned a little vessel called the "Bentley,"
sailed around Staten Island in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
time, and the duke gave him the tract of
land, on part of which the house is built, for
his services.</p>

<p>This first Christopher Billop died very
long ago. His only daughter married a
Thomas Farmar, who changed his name to
Billop, thereby acquiring the estate. It is
with the son of this couple that the tales of
the old house deal. The Billop family, like
most of the islanders, were loyalists, and
during the Revolution sided with their king.
When the war broke out the second Christopher,
a man of decided views and morose
temperament, was reigning over the plantation.
Many years before 1775 he had
married a beautiful island belle by the name
of Seaman and taken her home to his dreary
house. An interesting tradition says of her
that the month before she married she was
courted by three lovers: the Englishman
she married, a Huguenot, and a descendant
of the pious Waldeneses.</p>

<p>The nuptial coach which bore her away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
did not bring her to the road of happiness,
for the love between the husband and wife
was never what it should have been. Her
parents had sent her to a gilded cage. Soon
her lord and master began to neglect her for
his horses and dogs or his field work, and
she was left alone in her great rooms to sigh
and weep for the happy times she knew in
her girlhood before Fate bound her an unwilling
prisoner. The fine brocades and
taffetas which formed her wedding portion
no longer delighted her, for there was seldom
any one but her sullen husband or the
black women to gaze upon them. In vain
she implored him to receive her friends, but
he would not gratify her. Life ran smoothly
enough for his liking, and he needed neither
fiddles nor the flutter of fashion to enhance
his happiness. Often on clear nights she
would gaze from her chamber window on
the lights in the castles over the water. How
brightly they shone! and in her imagination
seemed to beckon her. Then to her mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
would come a flood of memories. She would
see herself in Love Grove, dancing on the
green of a fair day, with all the populace of
the little capital assembled to behold the
frolics of the quality. Now the Governor
gives her a garland of flowers, for she is
queen of a spring-time revel. In the ballroom
of Edinborough Castle, the home of
the Johnstone family, she flits. Over the
memoried voices of violins would come the
picture of a score of cavaliers bending low
to the belle from a sister isle, and often the
face of a boy would haunt her,&mdash;a boy more
dashing and gayer than all the others. They
were in the lantern-hung Watson garden the
night the nephew of the old Scotch painter
gave a f&ecirc;te when his penurious uncle was
away at Woodbridge, and youthful Amboy
entered into the frolic with zest. It was a
sweet revenge for past injuries to feast on
the miser's hoard. When a raid on the wine-cellar
was planned, she stayed on alone with
him in the garden. The laughter in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
mocking eyes died away; he was urging her
to fly with him to England. Beyond the wall
of green which shut away the cliff a merchantman
was anchored, and on board her
were his travelling chests, for he was sailing
back to his father's home on the morrow. He
loved her, and would she go with him? Out
into the tangle of green he led her down to
the road overlooking the river. The night
was very still, and through the sweet-scented
darkness fresh with the breath of June they
wandered hand in hand. Suddenly before
their eyes spread the line of the town and
beyond lay the sea of molten silver. Just
below them the dark ship rested in a shadowy
pool. She could not sail away with him to
an unknown land. Fear overcame her love,
and later in the night she tearfully wished
him God-speed on his journey, and for a
time he was forgotten.</p>

<p>The river before her would become a
dream-river bearing her away through the
portals of the past. The commonplace fabric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of her days was forgotten. She was like
one of those rare flowers that give their
greatest beauty to the night. Without her
visions life would have been a maddening
monotone; and so she went about the duties
of a colonial wife.</p>

<p>The early portion of 1776 was a poor
thing full of dreariness to Mrs. Billop. She
was leaving her girlhood far behind in her
walk with Time. Each year was a repetition
of the one past. The plantation of one thousand
five hundred acres was a little world of
its own, and she rarely went beyond its gates.
Most of her working hours she spent in her
garden, and under her fostering care it became
a spot of loveliness. In the circles of
roses flanked by humbler flowers and the tall
line of lilies that crept like a stately band of
pure-souled fairy sentinels down to the riverside
she planted some of her own fragrant
heart. Sometimes her garden was to her like
an only child, and then, again, the relationship
was changed, and the garden was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
tender mother and she herself the weary
thing that sought peace there on a breast of
green. But one day a wonderful thing happened.
Awakened by the sunlight gilding
the narrow panes of her bedroom windows,
she heard shouts in the barley-field. "Dey
am coming! dey am coming!" the household
slaves were calling in merry voices. Mrs.
Billop, drawing her curtains, saw in the path
leading to the house a body of scarlet-coated
cavaliers mounted on mettlesome steeds. It
came to her mind that a horseman had dashed
over from Richmond a week before, telling
of General Howe's arrival. These horsemen
must be some of his officers making a
tour of the island, she thought. For the first
time in many years gentlemen were coming
to stop at the manor. A smile crept over her
face as she gazed upon them, and then she
softly let down the curtain.</p>

<p>When the day had advanced another hour
by the sundial outside the boxwood grotto
a vision stood on the landing at the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the stairs and spread out the panniers of a
long-unused gown. The hall below was filled
with the badinage of masculine voices, and
the surly Christopher, forced into playing
the host, seemed to be performing the part
with no poor grace. Black women in India
print dresses were passing bowls of summer
punch, and from the kitchen came the pungent
scents of limes and the redolence of
roasting corn.</p>

<p>From her vantage-point the wife viewed
it all, and then began slowly to descend. As
the rustle of the brocade became louder and
the odor of attar of roses more perceptible,
the noise stopped all of a sudden, and every
eye was focussed on the woman garbed as
if going to a Franklin ball. Little they
knew that she was wearing her wedding attire
that had lain folded many years in her
mother's cedar chest brought from home.</p>

<p>High towered her hair of the brown-red
color of autumn leaves, and rouge and black
lustre helped bring out the charms of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
face. White as the white-thorn bush in the
garden was her sweeping brocade, and on
her arm a love-knot caught a tiny Bambini
fan.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, sirs," she called, in a
voice that charmed all the company, as they
bowed low, save her husband, who gazed at
her with astonishment and rage. But she
did not heed his angry looks. Before her at
the foot of the stairs there stood a gallant
youth by the name of Harry Fairleigh. He
alone held her eyes. Where had she seen
that strong face tanned by the ocean wind?
In an instant she knew. He was the embodiment
of a dream&mdash;her boy lover grown
older&mdash;the cherished girlhood vision of her
true mate. The Revolution had brought him
to America again and Fate led him to her
very doorstep. Something seemed to be
swaying her. She caught his eyes and read
in them that he knew her. As he came forward
to kiss her hand, she seemed filled with
an awful joy,&mdash;a feeling that tortured and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
hurt as it swept over her,&mdash;for she knew that
he had come too late.</p>

<p>The islanders welcomed the British gladly.
Soon General Howe's brother arrived with
an additional force of twenty thousand men,
and General Clinton, repulsed at Charleston,
hurried north with a re-enforcement of
three thousand more, making the combined
forces somewhere near thirty-three thousand.
At the Rose and Crown Tavern near
New Dorp, the Black-Horse at Richmond,
the Ship near Prince's Bridge, and in farmhouses
from end to end of the island hundreds
of the soldiers had their quarters. In
that month of July the interest of the colonists
was centred on Staten Island. Every
Tory maid who dreamt of scarlet coats and
golden epaulets thought with envy of those
fortunate fair ones surrounded by such
multitudes of would-be admirers. Many a
modern household descended from loyalist
settlers retains tokens of that gala period.
Now it is a chair that some visiting genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
made when off duty, perhaps a paste buckle,
or a miniature which witnessed some story
woven in a summer month before the
wheels of the Revolution began to move
swiftly.</p>

<p>No longer could Mrs. Billop complain of
lacking company. Her husband, under the
influence of his foreign guests, was becoming
a changed man, and the fame of his hospitality
was known even in New York. All
through the war there was a constant stream
of visitors. Among the famous ones could
be mentioned Major Andr&eacute;, General Knyphausen,
Sir Henry Clinton, and General
Robertson. Many times Fairleigh would
ride over from Richmond to take part in
some festivity. His manly beauty always
made him a noted figure, and his admirers
called him the English Apollo. Billop, by
some strange intuition, seemed to hate him,
and longed to forbid him the house. One
night his rage obtained mastery over his prudence,
and he rushed into his garden, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a dance was in progress, and demanded that
he stop his minuet with Mrs. Billop and
leave the company. Those were days of hot
words and flashing steel, and soon the moon
shone on the glint of crossing swords. The
wife, terrified that harm should come to the
young soldier on her account, threw herself
between the combatants, and, in the face of
her husband's threats, it is said that she
promised to dance with Fairleigh again at
some future time. But she reckoned not
with war. Soon the drum and fife notes
sounded in every part of the island, and the
gallant young soldier marched away with his
regiment, carrying what was left of the heart
of the beautiful Mrs. Billop.</p>

<p>On the bloody field of Monmouth Fairleigh
fell in the thick of the fight, and Mrs.
Billop's promise was never to be fulfilled in
life. Evil days fell upon the Bentley manor.
Christopher Billop was dragged away to
Burlington to languish chained to the jail
floor, if we are to believe Elias Boudinot's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
stern order to the keeper of the jail, written
in November, 1779. In one of the rooms
General Howe met the peace envoys after
the disastrous battle of Long Island, and
later the Billops were forced to flee, as the
property was declared confiscated by the new
government.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, when the house was in
the hands of aliens, the story goes that one
of the new-comers was startled on a July
night by the appearance of two ghostly
figures that seemed to come out of the boxwood
grotto and dance a stately minuet
along the garden paths. Every year, it is
said, they still come back. When the trees are
in their fullest foliage and the earth carpeted
with flowers, the shades of the unhappy wife
and the laughing-eyed soldier she could have
loved haunt the neglected garden, and with
only a sighing wind for music, they bow and
sway through the tangled paths until the
morning stains the dreary faces of the decaying
castles across the water.</p>

<p class="tch">Major Andr&eacute;'s Last Love</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T the foot of Broadway, New York
City, there is a little plot of grass,
surrounded by a rusted iron railing, which
is a part of the one-time Bowling Green.
In old Knickerbocker days and up to the
time of the Revolutionary War it played an
important part in the history of the Colony.
When the British occupied the city it was
often used as a romping-ground by the
neighborhood's Tory children and the waifs
of the alley-ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>There in the summer of 1779 a happy-faced
youth with sparkling dark eyes and
hair lightly powdered would sometimes be
seen sketching a group of frolicsome urchins
as they rolled their hoops or played games
among the bushes. He was Major John
Andr&eacute;, then acting as an aide-de-camp to
General Clinton and living at his head-quarters.</p>

<p>One bright May day after the capture of
Stony Point, when sweet airs were stealing
over from the fragrant wilderness Paulus
Hook, and the road Broadway was like a
glittering golden ribbon drawn through a
world of summer time, Major Andr&eacute; loitered
near his favorite seat on the greensward.
Toying with his pencil, he glanced
up to see a chair pass by on its way up from
Whitehall. By its side walked three cavaliers
dressed in the height of fashion and
looking as if they might have just stepped
out of Court Alley. Its window-panels
were down to let in the air, and as it rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the green the young soldier from his point
of view caught a glimpse of one of the
fairest faces he had viewed during his American
career. Soft brown hair rolled high
above eyes of the same shade and a complexion
as beautiful as the apple-blossoms of
old Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Who the maiden was he longed to inquire,
but no one was by, and in an instant the chair
had passed. His eyes followed it, and as it
turned in its triumphal course into one of the
upper streets he saw a white hand rest for
an instant above the door and wave the end
of a fichu. All day long the memory of the
lovely face and the waving fichu stayed with
him.</p>

<p>Looking out of a window of Sir Henry
Clinton's drawing-room at nightfall, he saw
the same chair on its homeward way, followed
by another. Then he learned from
some of his brother officers that the vision of
the morning was Sally Townsend, a belle of
Long Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>General Sir Henry Clinton was then
occupying the mansion No. 1 Broadway.
It was a spacious house with a garden extending
to the river. Only a portion of his
time was spent there, for when the weather
grew extremely warm he departed with his
household for the Beekman mansion at
Turtle Bay. In the garden of the former
place, one of the noted pleasure-spots in the
city, Major Andr&eacute; is said to have composed
his poem "The Cow Chase." These quaint
verses would perhaps be forgotten to-day if
the one who penned them had not been immortalized
by calamity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<a id="TOWNSEND"><img src="images/illus217.jpg" width="388" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">THE TOWNSEND GARDEN</div>
</div>



<p>Although the British officers made New
York a theatre of amusement in which the
candles never flickered or died out for a
space of many months, the dashing Andr&eacute;
could not have found it as agreeable a spot
as Philadelphia. In that city he planned the
famous Meschianza in honor of jovial Sir
William Howe, and was acclaimed the hero
of the hour. Fame to him seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
been an instinctive passion, and although of
a family humbler than most of those of his
scarlet-coated compatriots, he rose like a
meteor above the shackles of environment
and became the favorite of his regiment. It
is small wonder that a youth who could correspond
with the learned Anna Seward, as he
did at the age of eighteen, should have hated
his work in the mercantile shop of old Warnford
Court. Looking back over the years
to-day, he appears to us a paragon. That
the "Cher Jean" of that humble home circle
at Litchfield should be described by all his
faithful biographers in most glowing colors
is singular proof that he could not have
fallen far short of their eulogiums. Of unusual
personal beauty, a poet, artist, linguist,
and musician, he lives for us again the handsome
limner the belle of Long Island waved
to on an early summer's day.</p>

<p>The love-affairs of Major Andr&eacute; have
always created as much discussion as the justice
of his lamented fate. Whether he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
true to that paragon of virtues, Honora
Sneyd, as has often been written, or forgot
her for Peggy Chew, Rebecca Redman, or
any of the host of colonial beauties whose
names have been linked with his, can never be
answered. This we know, that after she was
married to another, "the endless Mr. Edgeworth,"
Andr&eacute; still wore her miniature, and
he himself tells us that he secreted it in his
mouth when taken a prisoner at Quebec.
His affection for her was pure and lofty,
and in his sprightly and characteristic letters
to Anna Seward, her foster-sister, who corresponded
with him under the pseudonym of
"Julia," we obtain glimpses of a hopeless
passion; of a lover who truly loved and
longed, but was never an accepted suitor. In
the fall-time of 1769 he writes to "Julia"
from the midst of the implements of "quill-driving"
in the London establishment:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<a id="MAJOR"><img src="images/illus221.jpg" width="448" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">MAJOR JOHN ANDR&Eacute;.</span></div>
</div>



<div class="bq">
<p>"Instead of figuring a merchant as a middle-aged
man, with a bob wig, a rough beard, in snuff-colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
clothes, grasping a guinea in his red hand,
I conceive a comely young man, with a tolerable
pigtail, wielding a pen with all the noble fierceness
of the Duke of Marlborough brandishing a truncheon
upon a sign-post, surrounded with types and
emblems, and canopied with cornucopias that disembogue
their stores upon his head; Mercuries reclin'd
upon bales of goods; Genii playing with
pens, ink, and paper, while in perspective his gorgeous
vessels launched on the bosom of the silver
Thames, are wafting to distant lands the produce
of this commercial nation. Thus all the mercantile
glories crowd on my fancy, emblazoned in the most
effulgent coloring of an ardent imagination. Borne
on her soaring pinions, I wing my flight to the time
when Heaven shall have crowned my labors with success
and opulence. I see sumptuous palaces rising
to receive me; I see orphans, and widows, and
painters, and fiddlers, and poets, and builders protected
and encouraged; and when the fabrick is
pretty nearly finished by my shattered pericranium,
I cast my eyes around and find John Andr&eacute; by a
small coal fire in a gloomy compting house in Warnford
Court, nothing so little as what he has been
making himself, and in all probability never to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
much more than he is at present. But, oh! my dear
Honora! it is for thy sake only I wish wealth."</p></div>

<p>Later in the day he pictures his Honora
and a few of her friends forming a snug
circle about her dressing-room fireplace, and
gives vent to the wish that he were with
them. Then comes the closing hour of the
"compting house," and he writes, "I am
about to jog to Clapton on my own stumps;
musing as I homeward plod my way&mdash;Ah!
need I name the subject of my contemplation?"</p>

<p>Although Honora Sneyd was the grand
passion of Andr&eacute;'s life, he had a gay and
volatile temperament, and many a pretty
face caught his fancy after donning the
king's livery; and so we find him in the days
that followed his meeting with the belle of
Long Island journeying to her home in
Oyster Bay.</p>

<p>The house where Sally Townsend resided
still stands on the main street. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
building was erected by Samuel Townsend
in 1740, and is little changed since the day
Sally's gallant British admirers used to
hurry over from wind-swept Fort Hill in
search of her. The Townsends were among
the first Long Island settlers, having purchased
land in this village in 1661. One of
the early daughters of the family, by the
name of Freelove, married the famous
pirate, Tom Jones, as dreaded by Long
Islanders as Captain Kidd was farther
south. Their house at Massapequa, known
as "the pirate's house," remained standing
until well into the last century. An interesting
tradition is often told of it. When
the pirate lay on his death-bed a great black
bird hovered over the roof, circling about the
chimney. As his breath was ceasing it flew
through the western wall, and no one ever
succeeded in closing the hole that its strong
wings made, the bricks and mortar always
tumbling out as fast as put in place.</p>

<p>Tom Jones had long been a troubled shade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
if we credit the tales of ghost-hunters, when
Major Andr&eacute; first came to Oyster Bay.
Colonel Simcoe, commander of the Queen's
Rangers, was then quartered at the Townsend
house, and General Clinton's aide, on
his week's leave of absence from New York,
knew he would receive a warm welcome from
him. It was noonday when he and two of his
fellows arrived at the village; a market lad
directed them to the house. Wilting under
the rays of the hot sun, they were longing
for the cool strip of Quogue's beach.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was inwardly lamenting his foolhardiness
in coming such a long distance
simply to get a closer view of a maiden who
had waved a kerchief at him. As they approached
the wide gray shadow of the Townsend
dwelling the noise of some disturbance
from within met their ears. There was a
clatter of china-ware, deep, boisterous laughter,
and a woman's voice in shrill accents.
"Don't!" and "Lud!" and then "Keep it
up!" floated out through the windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Andr&eacute; parted the plumes of a high peony-bush,
stood on tiptoe, and gazed in at the
scene. A girl, dodging a line of lusty
youths pursuing her about a table filled
with steaming viands, stopped in her flight.</p>

<p>For a moment she gazed at the man's head
and shoulders rising out of the plant in the
garden. To both their minds came the picture
of a patch of grass at the foot of Broadway
and the memory of a waving bit of
white gauze. The girl blushed and so did
the man over the peonies. The noise was
still going on about her. For a moment she
hesitated, then, rushing to the window, she
merrily called, "Help! Help!" One of the
young soldiers had also caught a glimpse of
Andr&eacute; and recognized him.</p>

<p>"'Tis John Andr&eacute;, Clinton's aide, coming,"
he said; but the words had no more
than left his mouth when a biscuit hit the
spot from whence they came.</p>

<p>"Take that, and that," the rescuer cried,
as he aimed the crispy balls at the ungallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
youths. "Shame on you! Four lads to one
maid!"</p>

<p>The men were laughing.</p>

<p>The girl had become silent and her cheeks
were flaming scarlet. "'Twas a game of
forfeits, sir," she cried, "and they took
advantage. I shall call the others of your
tribe, gentlemen," she said, turning to her
tormentors. There was scorn in her voice,
but her eyes smiled on Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>Later in the day Andr&eacute; sat at the feet of
Sally Townsend, as she shelled peas in a
grotto at the back of the house. Almost
up to the entrance of the spot which she
herself had planned in imitation of a Ranleagh
grotto marched an army of radiant
blooms. Over their fragrant faces hovered
a band of butterflies, and now and then a
brigand bee droned of his thefts to a heedless
world. Every Simcoe redcoat was away
drilling in a distant field. The house seemed
like some great white bird asleep in the sun.
The man and the girl under the cool arch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
cedar boughs were facing each other. Even
the brook in the distance had stopped its
murmuring.</p>

<p>"And why did you wave to me that morn
on Broadway as you journeyed to your
Aunt's?" Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>"'Twas all a mistake, I told you. I took
you for some one else," the girl replied.</p>

<p>"Tell me, was he much like me?" he began
again.</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "Why press me, Major
Andr&eacute;?" she said.</p>

<p>The peas were flying through her rosy
fingers. The young soldier by her side
reached out to a gaudy poppy and broke
it from its frail stem. Now he was playing
with it. A shaft of sunlight had strayed
over from the flower field and was loitering
on his unpowdered hair, beating it into gold.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spoke:</p>

<p>"I came all the way from York to obtain
another view of you, Miss Townsend. The
face by the chair window was so wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sweet. Won't you tell me why you
waved?"</p>

<p>The girl bent her head over the pea-pods.
The bees, for a moment deep in the honeyed
hearts of the flowers, were silent. The hot
world seemed like a colored print in a picture-book,
brilliant but without life.</p>

<p>"If you must know," she said, hesitatingly,
"I thought for a moment you
were the man I love. The color of the coat
showed me my mistake."</p>

<p>She was smiling at his chagrin.</p>

<p>There was a silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Where is your rebel to-day?" he said,
when he had cast his dream away.</p>

<p>A look of sadness came over her face and
tears choked her voice as she answered, "God
knows!"</p>

<p>It was the calls of old Miss Townsend for
her evening vegetables which broke up the
visions of the two. The girl's last words had
brought to Andr&eacute;'s mind a picture of his
Honora separated from him by miles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
miles of ocean. Did she care whether he
followed this new beauty? he asked himself.
No; she had forgotten him. He looked at
Sally. Where were her eager thoughts now?
With some slender youth tramping along a
Jersey road, perhaps. She was following
him through the dark forest where he walked
with bleeding feet. Camp-fires glowed before
her eyes as he ate his starvation rations,
the wind whistled in her ears with its shriek
of musketry and deep roar of cannon. Now
she gazed upon him wounded and creeping
over the mossy turf to some stream to quench
his thirst of death. The agony of it was
awful.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; saw the horror in her face.</p>

<p>"Poor girl," he whispered, "he is safe
somewhere, I know; my heart feels sure
of it."</p>

<p>Sally rose and he carried her basket into
the kitchen, where a slave woman took it,
murmuring protestations of thanks. There
was no room in the house for him to sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
but Sally assured him that he could find a
lodging at the tavern.</p>

<p>"May I come and see you to-night?" he
said, when they reached the garden gate.</p>

<p>"You had better not," she answered.
"You know me only as a hoyden with silly
wits. I should hate all of you redcoats!"</p>

<p>"Let me come and I will talk only of
him," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Then come," she said. "King George
has the whole village in his power, and besides,"
she added, "you somehow make me
think of Jack." And her eyes followed him
as he walked down the street, turning often
to bow to her until the night folded him in
her arms.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute; hath captured the belle," was the
verdict of every Simcoe officer quartered at
Townsend's. They had become firm friends.
The gay young officer had journeyed into
the country in search of a pretty face and
had found a good heart. Andr&eacute; settled in
his mind that the waving fichu was but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
caprice of a moment; the act of a young
and thoughtless girl who never hoped to see
him again. Did he really look like Jack? he
often asked himself. From Sally he heard
of that youth's good parts, and soon began to
feel a strange sympathy for him. Before
the war he was the master of the village
school. He was a dreamer and a writer of
sweet verses who should have had naught to
do with battle.</p>

<p>In a little vine-covered cot by the king's
highway his mother dwelt, breeding doves
and rarer birds for a livelihood. There were
few sales for her now. Andr&eacute; passed her
sometimes, seated by her doorstep, her
wrinkled old face turned towards the west
road where she had followed her best beloved
to the turnpike one bright morning
two years before. Her eyes were like those
of a troubled parent bird, as she often sat
there brooding. Once he went to see her
with Sally. The girl had told him more of
her lover. In a burst of confidence she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
informed him that they were not even betrothed;
his poverty forbade him the house.
Andr&eacute; sighed with her over the tale of no
letters. There was one who never wrote to
him, too, but alas! from choice. Once he
showed this younger woman her miniature.
He was growing to love Sally as a brother
would. They were so alike with their smiles
and their laughter, yet each with a sad secret.
At Philadelphia and York, where gayety
was rife, the image of his Honora did not
come before him as often as it did in this
quiet village.</p>

<p>With Sally, Andr&eacute; would leave the house
ostensibly to walk over to the camp, but, once
away from prying eyes, they would wander
off through the pines to heathy wastes where
the golden-rod tossed its tassels knee high,
and through fields green and riant, filled
with the very passion of ripe summer. It
was on these walks that they entered into the
closest communion. All their superficialities
seemed to vanish. Andr&eacute; forgot the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
beauties the God of Love had led his footsteps
to in America, and for the time was
the simple "Cher Jean" of younger days.
The girl by his side felt stronger with him.
Jack must be safe, for he said so. "You
will find him again and happiness," he would
often tell her. "The world cannot be all
made up of dreary days." And a smile
always followed the sigh.</p>

<p>On the fifth day of Andr&eacute;'s stay in Oyster
Bay he wandered with Sally as usual beyond
the outskirts of the township. Starting
for home when the sunbeams were beginning
to fade along the roadway, they came
upon a fisherman's wife driving an empty
cart. The woman was all excitement, and in
a jumbled Dutch dialect tried to tell them
of something that had happened, pointing
often to the village. She evidently feared
Andr&eacute;, for her eyes resting on him were
filled with hatred. Sally was used to seeing
the woman pass by the Townsend gate.
What could she mean by her queer actions?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
She was evidently trying to tell them that
something had been taken from her.</p>

<p>"Her fish may have been seized by the
soldiers, poor thing!" the girl said, as, still
gesticulating wildly, they watched her drive
away. When she was out of sight the two
hurried on.</p>

<p>The sun left the tree-tops and sank into
a misty grave. Gray vapors stole over the
meadows. The day was dying sadly. The
dew came suddenly upon the countryside
and drenched all its varicolored beauty in
tears. The wings of a storm could be heard
in the distance. Andr&eacute; seized his companion's
hand and they ran laughingly with
the wind.</p>

<p>The girl paused for breath. Her face
changed. "Major Andr&eacute;," she said, "what
do you think the woman meant?"</p>

<p>"'Twas her fish," he said, to comfort her.</p>

<p>Nature's swift transition coming upon
them so silently gave him a strange foreboding
of impending trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>They were entering the street; the storm
was at their backs. The day was stifled in
a sable pall. There was a roll of thunder and
a swift flash of lightning illumined the sky.
Then out of the sullen blackness loomed the
house, a sheet of fire, candles glowing in
every room. A group of townspeople were
about the door. Sally ran from Andr&eacute;'s
side. Old Miss Townsend sat on the doorstep
weeping, with her head in her apron.
Sally looked at her and then at the faces
about her. Most of the people were Tories,
and there was little in their eyes but curiosity.
Two or three neighbors glanced at
her tenderly, and one stepped forward as
if to speak, then checked herself. Inside
there was the murmur of many voices.
One that lived ever in her heart now came
to her ears like an evil dream. Her face
blanched. Andr&eacute; was by her side in an
instant.</p>

<p>"'Tis Jack," she whispered. In the hall
she saw him bound and bleeding. His face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was thin and haggard. There were bayonets
all about him.</p>

<p>"You cannot enter here yet a while," a
sentinel called out; but her ears were heedless.
In Andr&eacute;'s arms she had swooned.
The few who remained by the door were
bending over her; about them roared the
storm.</p>

<p>Sally's lover had been captured that afternoon
in a rye field a mile from his home.
He was dressed in a cheap, soiled homespun,
and would have passed as a farmer's lad if
a townsman vigilant in the service of King
George had not recognized him. The youth
was free after a long incarceration in a
British warehouse prison in New York
City. Many a weary mile he had skirted
homeward bound. His one thought was to
reach his mother's cool little cot again. The
fever was still in his veins. He was nearing
the road to rest when the soldiers ran out
upon him. To his distraught fancy they
seemed like red devils eager to drag him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
back to hades. Off over the fields he could
see the roof of Sally's home. How glad she
would be to see him again! Farther on was
the little house he loved so well. The storm-clouds
were beginning to form over it. His
mother was no doubt bringing in the birds
now from the willow garden house. Hark!
was that the faint call of Rollin, his own pet
bluewing?</p>

<p>"Yes, he belongs to the rebel forces," he
heard a voice cry out. "He must be here
spying." Grim faces pressed closer to him.
Cruel hands bound him. Death was whispering
to him&mdash;mocking. A thoughtless
youth who carried a flute began to play
the doleful music of "The Rogues' March."
On they went to the tribunal.</p>

<p>Colonel Simcoe, who was kind at heart,
could not condemn the young prisoner to
death when there was little proof that he
was a spy. His men had searched him for
possible papers, but none were to be found.
"Still, he may be a clever trickster," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
mused. After consulting with his chief
officers, it was decided to give out a mock
sentence that he was to die on the morrow,
to see whether aught could be learned from
him. Then Major Andr&eacute;, who had helped
old Miss Townsend carry the prostrate Sally
to her chamber, stood by the door from
whence emanated justice when the verdict
was reached. "If he is hung it will kill the
poor maid," he thought. Through the ante-room
he saw the prisoner. His head was
drooping; the very attitude of his body
betokened abject despair. "Poor lad," he
said; "can Simcoe mean to carry out the
murder?"</p>

<p>The storm was ceasing. So grave were the
affairs over which the little world in the
Townsend house were concerned that the
night was on them unawares. The hour
was long past the usual evening meal-time.
The sentence of death sickened the hearts
of all of those not in the plot. The court
was about to break up when the prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
asked permission to speak with Colonel
Simcoe.</p>

<p>For the last hour they had been trying to
wring from him that which he knew not.
Was this a confession? The thought of
death was a compelling force. A hush fell
upon the room, broken only by the sputter
of a candle.</p>

<p>"Colonel Simcoe," he said, "as this is to be
my last night on earth, I ask of you a favor."
He had suddenly grown pale like one arisen
from a weary couch of sickness. "'Tis a
great boon to ask, sir, and I have naught to
give in exchange but my word. I came to
this place to-day solely with the thought of
seeing my old mother&mdash;and one other," he
added, hesitatingly. "This has cost me my
life, and I beg that you will let me go to
her just for an hour or two, and I promise to
come back again. Half a mile down the
road is our house. She is thinking of me
now, poor soul!" His voice had sunk into
a whisper. "The bird woman; perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
you know her, sir. You must trust me to
go, and go alone. The knowing I am a
prisoner would kill her. Do I ask too
much?"</p>

<p>The officer looked at the youth. 'Twas
a prodigious request, but bespoke honesty.
The words touched a hidden part of his nature.
The fair white face before him with
the eager eyes brought back to him dead
faces dreaming under cypress-trees. "I will
set you free for two hours," he said, "on
your promise to come back."</p>

<p>"I promise to return by all that I hold
sacred," the youth answered.</p>

<p>The cords that bound his swelling arms
were loosened. The great hall door swung
back for freedom, and he staggered out into
the garden. The storm was over. After the
brightness of the room his eyes could not
penetrate the darkness. A dash against a
drenched rose-bush brought a cloud of raindrops
and loosened petals on his head. The
dampness and the faint odor of the flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
awakened him. A wind was arising, making
a low murmur among the bushes.</p>

<p>Suddenly it came over him that he was
leaving Sally's house. Only the Townsends
had white garden-posts. Sally! How sweet
the name! Long, long ago it was that he
bade her good-by in the meadow. He felt
her kiss on his cheek now. Then the wind
sighed, "You are to die!&mdash;to die!"</p>

<p>A chill was creeping over him&mdash;he was to
go back to the great house. No, it was not
right. He was young; he was free; he could
escape to the forest, and they would never
know. For a moment he turned and looked
at it, then hurried off into the road.</p>

<p>He began to run slowly at first, gradually
increasing his pace until his strength was
taxed to its utmost. He was a wild, hunted
thing that the forces of the world were about
to drown. A wet blanket was over the
earth. Watery trees touched him with their
wet arms, making him shudder. Deep pools
in the middle of the roadway showed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
his shadow. Dark, wet things flew out at
him from coverts and joined his mad course.
The wind was at his heels, growing louder
and more insistent. "You are to die!&mdash;to
die!" it shrieked. Now he was battling with
it. "I cannot die!&mdash;I shall not die!" his soul
said. On he plunged.</p>

<p>It was his own log school-house overlapping
the road that stopped him. Close to his
path it stood like some grim sentinel. Before
it he paused, his breath coming in short
gasps. "You must go back," it whispered.
"You have promised." "I cannot die," he
answered; but he lingered by it as if afraid
to go on. The wind was lessening; it no
longer challenged him. In its sweep he now
heard the voices of children. "Here you
taught us the meaning of faith and honor."
Over the years he saw them all. A long line
of eager little forms were stealing through
a gate whose latch was rusted. Where were
they all to-night: the merry boys who
dreamed of playtimes over dull books; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
girls with their flowers and apples for the
master? No longer would he guide them.
They were gone forever from him. The
wind had caught their droning voices. A
lad who wore the dunce-cap often was before
him. He saw him stolid and indifferent
in the corner of the dreary room; then again,
awakened by the call of war, he was by his
side, a drummer-boy, charging the heights of
Bergen. The dunce was not afraid to die.
"You will go back," the voices wailed, and
he answered, "Yes!"</p>

<p>The moon was throwing off the mist veils,
and her first pale beams sent earthward
showed him his mother's cot. There were
no lights in the windows. He approached
the door and stood by it shivering. An awful
fear came over him that perhaps she was
away. A fourth of his time was already
gone. What if he could not see her again?
He longed to feel her tender arms about
him, and yet he knew that the agony of leaving
them would be more than he could bear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
He dared not knock, but crept softly to an
open window. In the old stole-band rocking-chair
she was seated close to a dying fire,
her eyes closed by sleep. The worn strip of
wool rag carpet he knew so well was smooth
beneath her feet. A pair of finches were
twittering softly in their cage by the south
window. Over the broad sill he climbed as
in the days of his boyhood. To her side he
crept and began to stroke her calloused,
tired hands. His touch brought her back
from her visionary realm. "Is he dead?"
her waking lips murmured, and then she saw
her son.</p>

<p>At the Townsend house none of the officers
knew that the youth who left them was
anything to Sally. It was proper for a
tender-hearted maid to swoon at a danger.
After the door closed upon him there were
calls for the hostess. Was she revived?
Then Andr&eacute; stepped forward and told the
officers what the condemned youth was to
her. In his graphic way he repeated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
simple love-story. The eyes of all in the
room, expressing varying emotions, were
still centred on his face when a faint rustle
of women's garments was heard in the hall.
Andr&eacute; stopped speaking. In their midst
stood Sally, pale and with anguish in her
eyes. Miss Townsend was near her, wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>"Sirs," the girl said, "you have been here
nigh a month, and we have given you of our
best, hiding naught, although you are not of
our color." Her voice was breaking. "I,"
she continued, "have worked for you,
amused you, laughed for you, and now I
want my pay. You must give me an innocent
man's life. The one you have condemned
to death is not a spy. I swear it
before God!"</p>

<p>Bluff and hearty Colonel Simcoe, in the
act of drawing a goblet of port, lowered the
glass a few inches at each of the girl's passionate
outbursts. He began to feel of his
wig to see if it were awry. "Lud, here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a pretty to do," he murmured to himself.
The lady was a fine creature and her words
were true. He placed the heavy cut piece on
the table and then he spoke. "His death-sentence
was but a mock one," he said. "'Tis
our mind to set him free, yet 'twas necessary
to find out if he knew aught."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, let me have his life! Write it
on a paper that you set him free." The
girl's tones were entreating. "I must go to
him, and now."</p>

<p>For a moment the commander hesitated;
then Andr&eacute;'s voice rang out. "Those who
are for Sally unsheath their swords," he
cried. The room was full of flashing steel.
The pardon was in Sally's hand.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, as she turned and faced
the group of excited men.</p>

<p>The next moment she was out in the night,
followed by a line of supperless redcoats.</p>

<p>The moon, grown round and full, smiled
on the procession. Sally and Andr&eacute; headed
the company splashing through the wet road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
So intent were they on their errand that
scarcely any one spoke.</p>

<p>They were nearing the lights of the cottage
when Sally paused. Placing her finger
to her mouth to enjoin silence, she said,
"You must turn back, friends. The sight
of you all might kill his mother. 'Twas
thoughtless in asking you to come with me.
Andr&eacute;," she whispered, "you must stay to
bring me home."</p>

<p>"Brave little Sally!" a youth's lusty voice
rang out. The men surrounded her. One
by one they asked to kiss her hand, then
crept off through the dripping foliage. All
the while she was gazing at the house.
Rain-drops glistened in her hair and her
garments hung limp about her knees. Andr&eacute;
stood by her side seemingly lost in
thought. He was dreaming of days that
were dead. Softly she touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Andr&eacute;," she said, "I am afraid to go
in."</p>

<p>The crashing of twigs under foot died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
away in the distance; the clouds were all
swept out of the heavens and the night
seemed one vast ambient plain of loneliness.
The girl and the man in the middle of the
roadway drew closer to each other. Tenderly
he caught her trembling hands in his.
"Do not be afraid, Sally," he said; "you
will find happiness." His voice was breaking.
"Two hearts will always beat for you&mdash;one
belongs to the man in yonder cot and
the other to John Andr&eacute;." Softly she crept
from him to the door which opened into her
earthly Paradise.</p>

<p class="tch">Pinderina Scribblerus, an American
Montagu</p>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the great Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu
was receiving the <i>bas-bleus</i> of
London in her Hill Street drawing-room
there arose across the water a little American
salon which reflected in a degree the
spirit of the famous gatherings Admiral
Boscawen named after the slovenly Dr.
Stillingfleet's gray stockings. It is only
recently that historians have taken a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
marked interest in the literature which
followed in the wake of the Revolutionary
War and the world has learned that
in the newly-formed States there were a
few bright spirits whose lives and aspirations
reflected the culture of Europe. One
of the most interesting of these was Elizabeth
Kearny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lawrence, a daughter of
Judge Lawrence, of Burlington, and a
half-sister of Captain James Lawrence of
"Don't give up the ship" fame. She
formed a literary circle which flourished
for a few years in old Perth Amboy, Jersey's
fallen capital.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lawrence passed her early youth
in Burlington, where she pursued the study
of Greek and Latin, to the mild astonishment
of the community. Over her father's
library table in the Lawrence mansion, still
existing impervious to the encroachments of
time, she chatted as a girl with the Tory
satirist Jonathan Odell. She must have
imbibed some of his sarcasm, for in later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
years her loquacious tongue was barbed
with a wit almost Walpolian in its acrid
cleverness. At nearby Philadelphia she
met the famous Peggy Chew, and formed
an intimacy with Anne Willing, better
known as Mrs. William Bingham. The
"dazzling Bingham" she made the subject
of some animated verses, entitled,&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"LINES ON MRS. BINGHAM'S RECALL OF

</div>

<p>There are very few records of this remarkable
woman's girlhood still extant.
Her brother John, for whom she cherished
a strong attachment, was born after her
marriage to Mr. Michael Kearny, "the beloved
noble Michael," who erected her
Perth Amboy cottage. There she lived
as "the scribbling Mrs. Kearny, occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the highest seat on Parnassus," a power in
her world. Argus-eyed she evidently was,
for nothing seems to have escaped her facile
quill. There was scarcely a subject too
great or too small for her to digress upon,
and she wrote in the morning of "the
shameful performance of certain gentlemen
in Congress" and at night of "the
sorrow she felt on finding a slave under
the influence of pernicious rum."</p>

<p>About some of the streets of the city
named in honor of the "passionately
proud" Earl of Perth there lingers an
air of decayed opulence. Although old
Amboy of the scarlet coats died long ago,
a few of her echoes live on undrowned by
the din of new voices. In Mrs. Kearny's
day many a stately garden crept down to
the water-front. The great houses overlooking
the smooth Raritan still sheltered
a few of the noble Scotch and Irish
families who had unwillingly relinquished
their king and remained in the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
World. In the letters of Sophia Brown,
who lodged with the mother of William
Dunlap, the art historian, there are
glimpses of this society. The frail and
aristocratic Misses Parker with their tea-drinkings,
the gallant Captain Love, and
other charming figures, look out at us
from pages filled with the trivialities of
every-day life. A child dreaming beside a
broad pane overlooking the quiet street,
where trees stood in line as if awaiting the
call of Orpheus, saw many things. Now a
youthful pair sauntered by in the spring-time
of love, now an ancient crone in worn
satin shoes that had once touched ever so
lightly a king's feet in a long-forgotten
dance, and now a tired veteran of the
Revolution murmuring to himself of battles
still unwon. Suddenly would come the rush
of many footsteps. Off in the distance the
bell of St. Peter's tolls. People of condition
are to be married. Ladies in faded silk
or humble erminetta mince past gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in desay suits. Then the music creeps out
of the chancel,&mdash;the faint, sweet air of an
old English wedding-march. Even the
sombre fronts of the houses seem to be
ravished with it. The voices of the gentle
choir may not be as pure as they were in
the days of George III., but to the girl who
listened then they were like strains from
Paradise.</p>

<p>The city which had received its charter
one day after New York was at that
period beginning to lose its importance
in the eyes of the Western world. No
longer chariots drawn by white horses carried
a supercilious nobility to the resort of
the Knickerbockers. No longer big-wigs
talked over the commercial supremacy of
Perth Amboy in the Sweeting's Alley
Coffee House. No longer were there
stately minuets and revels at the Governor's
palace. The old days were gone forever;
but although the leading actors and the
lights had fled, the stage remained un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>changed.
That sad-faced baggage Poverty
loitered behind and came often to
once proud dwelling-places. Pinderina
heard the sighs of her friends, and decided
to enliven the situation. In the Kearny
Cottage, whose rooms seem to widen mysteriously
as one enters, she held her gatherings
of sympathetic souls. These affairs
differed somewhat from the parties given
at an earlier date by Mrs. Hugh Ferguson
and Mrs. Richard Stockton, two other literary
lights of the time, for the hostess suffered
from a slender purse. Her guests
came only for the pleasure of conversation,
without the "stomach compensation"
Mrs. Montagu and her American imitators
thought so necessary.</p>

<p>One of the most distinguished frequenters
of Mrs. Kearny's Blue-Stocking Club
was Philip Freneau, whose mother had
made a second matrimonial venture and
wedded Captain James Kearny, of Kearny Port,
a relative of the Perth Amboy family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
"Small but well formed, his blue eyes
sparkling with poetic fire," it is easy to
imagine him the lion of Mrs. Kearny's
evenings. Whenever the old sloop "King
William"&mdash;changed to "Liberty"&mdash;sailed
into Amboy, bringing Mr. Freneau to
pass the night with his friends before
journeying to Monmouth, there was always
great excitement in the town. Mrs.
Kearny's black Rebecca was sent forth in
haste to inform the chosen few of the neighborhood
that their leader bade them to her
drawing-room. The seven romping Kearny
boys were hurried up to the attic to bed, the
furniture rearranged, and Madam Scribblerus,
as her world called her, slipped on
her brocade gown to be in readiness for the
battle of wits sure to ensue. A happy
woman was this quaint personage when footfalls
began to sound on the gallery steps.
The rap-tap of the knocker made her spirits
buoyant, and each greeting took her farther
away from the cares of a commonplace existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Although she was a lover of nature,
she too could have said with Mr. Robinson,
the father of Mrs. Montagu, that living in
the country was like sleeping with one's eyes
open. Each breath of the world beyond
Amboy brought new life to her.</p>

<p>We can picture to ourselves the evening.
About the oddly-shaped room, on hard-seated,
fiddle-backed chairs, sits Pinderina's
little court. By the wide fireplace on the
settle old Judge Nevill, the editor of the
first American magazine, is blinking at the
embers. Mr. Freneau has finished telling
some of his recent adventures in New York
City. Now Mrs. Kearny begins the story
of Captain Kidd's black cat, which lived on
long after her master had been condemned
to death in Old Bailey, and for these two
hundred years has haunted the spot where
the bold adventurer is said to have buried
some of his chests of rupees. Sleepy eyes
grow wider as she advances in her narrative.
Timid ladies feel for each other's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
hands in the flickering light. The hostess is
in her element.</p>

<p>Taking a penetrating look at the company
over the years, they are not as we would at
first imagine them. There are holes in Mr.
Freneau's wrist ruffles, and the worn brocade
gown of the hostess no longer gives forth
even faint protesting rustle as she walks.
In this respect the circle is true-blue,&mdash;for
Oliver Goldsmith went to Mrs. Montagu's
in darned stockings and a laced coat, and
the immortal Johnson and many of his
confr&egrave;res were naturally careless in their
attire, or were helped to the state by the
lack of pence.</p>

<p>The one great ambition of Elizabeth
Kearny's life was to write like her "admired
Mr. Freneau," and her many mild
plagiarisms of his poems, if they failed in
their object, were no doubt regarded by
him as flattering homage to his genius.
Theirs was an unusual friendship of which
the world knows very little, but mute testimonials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
remain of it to-day in her letters
and her autographs fading under those of
Philip Freneau's in many of his favorite
volumes. She could have written of him
as Mrs. Montagu once wrote, thinking no
doubt of her faithful Dr. Beattie:</p>


<div class="bq">
<p>"Many guests my heart has not admitted; such
as there are do it honor, and a long and intimate
acquaintance has preceded their admittance; they
were invited in it by its best virtues; they passed
through the examination of severity, nay, even answered
some questions of suspicion that inquired of
their constancy and sincerity; but now they are
delivered over to the keeping of constant faith and
love; for doubt never visits the friends entirely,
but only examines such as would come in, lest the
way should be too common."</p></div>

<p>When Philip Freneau lived for a short
period over a little shop in the Fly-Market,
New York City, and edited <i>The Time Piece</i>,
Mrs. Kearny became one of its constant contributors.
Among that sentimental group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of female poets, numbering a Saraperina,
Edena, Cynthea, Clara, Carolina, and a
Petronella, her effusions&mdash;generally under
the <i>nome de guerre</i> of "Scribelra"&mdash;stand
forth in bold type. Turning the musty
pages of a bound volume of the paper, we
find</p>

<p class="center">"LINES BY A LADY ON HEARING
THE FROGS SING ON THE 17TH OF
MARCH.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Hail! pleasing harbingers of spring,</div>
<div class="verse">Who in the ponds so jocund sing;</div>
<div class="verse">And with a merry roundelay</div>
<div class="verse">Do usher in St. Patrick's day;</div>
<div class="verse">Some think your music rather hoarse,</div>
<div class="verse">Nay that 'tis altogether coarse;</div>
<div class="verse">Others ever fond of joking,</div>
<div class="verse">Swear your singing is but croaking.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet I declare it is to me</div>
<div class="verse">A pleasing, perfect harmony.</div>
<div class="verse">For in your varying notes I trace</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The counter, treble, tenor, bass.</div>
<div class="verse">Should <i>some</i> reply too <i>base</i> indeed,</div>
<div class="verse">Such rude sarcasms pray don't heed,</div>
<div class="verse">But in your old accustomed way</div>
<div class="verse">Still celebrate St. Patrick's day;</div>
<div class="verse">Whether to hail the saint you sing</div>
<div class="verse">Or joy for the returning spring,</div>
<div class="verse">Which doth your tribe from jail release,</div>
<div class="verse">Let not your annual tribute cease."</div>
</div>

<p>Although the merit of this poem lies much
below mediocrity, in subject it is delightfully
grotesque. Her style was varied and
her pen strangely moody, judging from
her productions extant. The following <i>jeu
d'esprit</i> was written at the beginning of
Jefferson's administration:</p>


<p class="center">"AN EPIGRAM.</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="verse">"Says William to Thomas I'll hold you a bet,</div>
<div class="verse1">That the French are confoundedly frighted;</div>

<div class="verse1">But they find that they staunch are, and righted.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"They slighted our Pleno's and made a demand</div>
<div class="verse1">That we a shameful tribute should pay them,</div>

<div class="verse">"But those who are born in the woods can't be scared</div>
<div class="verse1">By the croaking of Bull-frogs in ditches.</div>

</div>
</div> <!-- poem -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Among her poems are some pleasing
verses, entitled "A Whim." These also appeared
in <i>The Time Piece</i>, unsigned, and
we have nothing to show whether they were
a copy or the child of her own muse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"I gave&mdash;'twas but the other day&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">My Kate a ticket for the play,</div>
<div class="verse1">'Tis love such tricks imparts;</div>
<div class="verse">When holding up the card to me,</div>
<div class="verse">She laughed and said, the emblem see,</div>
<div class="verse1">And show'd the Knave of Hearts.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Amaz'd I cry'd, what means my dear?</div>
<div class="verse">A knave will lie, will steal, will swear;</div>
<div class="verse1">I pray, your words define.</div>
<div class="verse">She smiled and said, nay never start.</div>
<div class="verse">He's sure a knave that steals a heart,</div>
<div class="verse1">And you have stolen mine!"</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was one yearly occasion when the
world of Amboy did not flock with acceleration
to the Kearny Cottage, and that
was the anniversary of Michael Kearny's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
death. Mrs. Kearny was always fond of
writing epitaphs to embellish the tombstones
of departed Amboyites, but as the
years progressed she developed a very
morbid strain. To commemorate the demise
of her husband she wrote poems of
several hundred verses and then assembled
her satellites to weep with her. Woe to the
indifferent ones whose tears of sorrow were
dry. They were pretty sure of indignant
visits from her, or, worse still, her far-reaching
pen was capable of dealing them swift
retribution. She never spared the most
loyal of her friends. When one of the distinguished
men of the city came to her under
the effects of toddy, she celebrated his fall
from grace by lines which must have always
rankled in his breast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kearny longed to have her work admired
for its worth alone, and, like Miss
Burney, who visited the bookseller Mr.
Lownes as a chance purchaser of "Evelina"
to learn his opinion of its author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
"Pinderina" was in the habit of calling
upon her friends with her manuscripts, coyly
reading them, and then requesting their criticism
on the latest compositions she had
copied from the <i>Gazette</i>. Tradition says
that this plan did not always meet with
pleasant results. Descending upon a Mrs.
Golightly, a new-comer to Perth Amboy,
with a batch of her poems, she was told that
the productions were far from those of a
genius and must have been written by some
very foolish female. Pinderina, placidly
awaiting praise, was astounded at the intelligence.
Recovering herself, she informed
the unfortunate woman that her
own pen had given birth to the verses, and
left her house in high indignation.</p>

<div class="caption">THE WALK TO MRS. BELL'S MANSION</div>
</div>



<p>A new book was an event in the Perth
Amboy world at the beginning of the century.
When Simeon Drake, who received
the mail from Woodbridge three times a
week, brought a packet to the door of
Mrs. Andrew Bell, the wealthiest member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of the circle, a flutter of envy arose in every
breast. What anxious hours were passed before
it started on its round from house to
house. Ofttimes an impatient dame sent her
little Abigail to gaze through the low windows
of Mrs. Bell's study, where the lady
usually sat reading, to see if she were nearly
through with the volume. When the first
month of its Amboy life was over, how it
had been discussed! The golden urns and
garlands of roses which decorated the cover
were already worn. To-day high up in the
dust of dim attics the books of old Amboy
are content to rest neglected and forgotten.
The love that was given to them was
stronger and truer than that bestowed upon
their modern kindred. Through the long
years of summer suns and wintry rains they
had been happy in the thought of a mission
fulfilled. When the wind creeps through
the cracks in the casements and stirs their
musty pages, one can almost fancy that they
are whispering to the ghosts of the long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>A letter written by Mrs. Kearny to Mrs.
Bell has been preserved:</p>


<div class="bq">
<p>"I am much obliged to you Madam for your
Books. The scriptural essays are very good; the
author seems to have been fully inspired by his subject.
Rather enthusiastically so (I think) when he
prefers the story of Ruth to that of Lavinia. I
have long thought that Mr. Thomson had taken
that sacred history for his model but had no idea
that any one would say&mdash;the Paraphrase is inferior
to the original. The story of the unfortunate
lovers, very interesting&mdash;Carolina but so, so quite
middling; I read it through without being able to
approve of it. Allow me to mention a few remarks
I made when reading it&mdash;It, in my opinion, wants
two essential qualities Style and Reason; qualities
which you know are capable of making any story
pleasing&mdash;interesting, however fictitious we suppose
the circumstances to be.</p>

<p>"Ovid's metamorphoses are not more wonderful
than some of the turns of fortune in the history of
Carolina. I will instance the sudden and total
transformation of the Count of Wolstein. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>one who nature had designed for a tall and well
proportioned man should by a few months' studying
become hunchbacked&mdash;and by having a scar
on his face, one eye lost, and a limp in his gait,
should be so deformed as to be called a monster!
and that Carolina a young lady who had been two
months at court and likely had some idea of politeness
should when introduced to the Count instantly
hide her eyes with her hands, give a piercing shriek
and disappear like a flash of lightning at midnight
is demanding too much from our credulity. We
know pretty well what effect the loss of an eye, the
scar, and the limp might have had but we cannot
otherwise account for his other deformity than by
supposing that he sat in a remarkably uneasy posture,
or studied much more intently than any of our
modern statesmen do: not one of whom, I believe,
have broken their backs by studying politics however
their minds may be deformed by it. Don't
you think that the Canoness should have been
totally deaf, as well as nearly blind, whilst the
Pavilion was building in her garden?</p>

<p>"I can't for my part see the necessity of obliging
Carolina to <span class="smcap">HAVE</span> it built; as, had it been already
there. In adding the embellishments would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
been a sufficient surprise to her dear mama. In
short, I am of opinion that the author did not require
his readers to have common sense. Excuse the
liberty which I have taken with your Book and believe
me to be much obliged to you for the favor.</p>

<p class="right">
"Yours,<br />
"E. K."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The close of Mrs. Kearny's life was
blighted and narrowed by adversity. Money
matters estranged her from many of her old
intimates, and she wrote pathetically to each
member of the circle after a lawsuit with
Richard Stevens: "Have you too entered
the lists against me?" Unlike Mrs. Montagu,
of whom Wraxall recorded that she
wore glittering jewels to dazzle those her
reputation failed to astound, Mrs. Kearny's
last years were tinctured by the plaintiveness
of homespun.</p>

<p>In the fall-time of the year 1799 the Amboyites
who wandered past the wide lawns
of Franklin Palace often saw by one of the
windows of Kearny Cottage a figure bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
low over a writing-table. It was Mrs.
Kearny working industriously. Soon the
rumor went abroad that Pinderina was completing
her works for publication. No one
dared question her. Covert glances were bestowed
upon her when she entered her pew
in old St. Peter's on a Sabbath morning.
The thoughts of their former leader were to
be handed down to posterity in print. Betsey
Parker, one of the sisters at the castle
who had scoffed her effusions in secret, decided
to call at the cottage as soon as etiquette
would permit. Feuds over money
matters seemed trivial things after this great
news.</p>

<p>Pinderina's star was again in the ascendancy.
She smiled fondly on the pages of
finely-written manuscript she was putting
together. A glorious triumph seemed near
at hand. One morning Mr. Freneau was
seen leaving Kearny Cottage. After him
trotted a black boy, bearing aloft a heavy
bundle. Curious eyes watched him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
behind the partly closed shutters of many
a sedate-looking building facing the green.
The gossips felt sure that the fruit of Mrs.
Kearny's genius was being borne away for
the approval of the New York publishers.
They circulated the tale industriously. The
&eacute;lite of the town had not been so excited
since the day an irate Mrs. Franklin broke
all the mirrors of the palace on finding that
her husband had been made a prisoner of
war.</p>

<p>Three times the "Liberty" sailed into
Amboy. On each occasion bevies of ladies
found it necessary to transact business near
the wharf. A case of fine nabobs, which
had lain at old John's for a fortnight, was
suddenly discovered. Captain Goelet had
brought home some necklaces of Indian sea-shells.
Anything plausible was used as an
excuse to parade along the water-front.</p>

<p>And after all the weary watching Mr.
Freneau arrived by coach. A gray mist enveloped
the roadway that night, as if to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
his return a secret. But it was decreed that
he should be observed. A member of the
circle, who lived close by the cottage,
chanced to bring out on her balcony a
plant thirsting for rain. She recognized
the figure which alighted from the mud-bespattered
vehicle before Mrs. Kearny's
door. The wind spread wide his great-coat.
Its fluttering folds guarded from view the
package of manuscript which had been rejected
by the lords of New York's Printing
House Lane. The woman on the balcony
saw him enter the house; then she ran into
her own dwelling. It took but a few moments
to find the Hanway umbrella and the
lantern. Excitement overcoming her timidity,
she hurried out into the night to share
her news with the neighbors.</p>

<p>An hour later a few courageous souls
were wending their way to Pinderina's.
Each carried some peace-offering. A bowl
of white jelly, an ounce of Mr. Stebben's
snuff, an orange that had colored in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sunlit Amboy window were hidden beneath
wet garments. Before the worn door, which
the darkness and the rain made grim and
sinister looking, they huddled together.
Suddenly there was a noise inside. A
thrill went over the company as it swung
back and showed Pinderina holding a candle
aloft in her hands. "I know why you are
here," she said, gazing at them mockingly.
"It is not true. The villains have refused
my work." Some faithful member of the
circle started to speak, then stopped. "As
the poetess of Perth Amboy I have lived,
and as the poetess of Perth Amboy I shall
die," she continued. There were smiles in
the darkness,&mdash;the smiles akin to tears.</p>
